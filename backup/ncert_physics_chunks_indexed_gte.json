The result of a\nmeasurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a\nnumber (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.\nAlthough the number of physical quantities appears to be\nvery large, we need only a limited number of units for\nexpressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-\nrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or\nbase quantities are called fundamental or base units. The\nunits of all other physical quantities can be expressed as\ncombinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the\nderived quantities are called derived units. A complete set\nof these units, both the base units and derived units, is\nknown as the system of units.",

Three such\nsystems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS\nsystem were in use extensively till recently.\nThe base units for length, mass and time in these systems\nwere as follows :\n• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second\nrespectively.\n• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second\nrespectively.\n• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second\nrespectively.\nThe system of units which is at present internationally\naccepted for measurement is the Système Internationale\nd’ Unites  (French for International System of Units),\nabbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,\nunits and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau\nInternational des Poids et measures (The International\nBureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were\nrecently revised by the General Conference on Weights and\nMeasures in November 2018.

    "content": "1.3 SIGNIFICANT FIGURES\nAs discussed above, every measurement\ninvolves errors. Thus, the result of\nmeasurement should be reported in a way that\nindicates the precision of measurement.\nNormally, the reported result of measurement\nis a number that includes all digits in the\nnumber that are known reliably plus the first\ndigit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus\nthe first uncertain digit are known as\nsignificant\ndigits or significant figures. If we\nsay the period of oscillation of a simple\npendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are\nreliable and certain, while the digit 2 is\nuncertain. Thus, the measured value has three\nsignificant figures. The length of an object\nreported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has\nfour significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are\ncertain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,\nreporting the result of measurement that\nincludes more digits than the significant digits\nis superfluous and also misleading since it\nwould give a wrong idea about the precision of\nmeasurement.\nThe rules for determining the number of\nsignificant figures can be understood from the\nfollowing examples. Significant figures\nindicate, as already mentioned, the precision\nof measurement which depends on the least\ncount of the measuring instrument. A choice\nof change of different units does not\nchange the number of significant digits or\nfigures in a measurement.  This important\nremark makes most of the following\nobservations clear:\n(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four\nsignificant figures. But in different units, the\nsame value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08\nmm or 23080 µm.\nAll these numbers have the same number of\nsignificant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.\nPHYSICS4\nThis shows that the location of decimal point is\nof no consequence in determining the number\nof significant figures.\nThe example gives the following rules :\n• All the non-zero digits are significant.\n• All the zeros between two non-zero digits\nare significant, no matter where the\ndecimal point is, if at all.\n• If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)\non the right of decimal point but to the\nleft of the first non-zero digit are not\nsignificant. [In\n0.00 2308, the underlined\nzeroes are not significant].\n• The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber without a decimal point are not\nsignificant.\n[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has\nthree significant figures, the trailing zero(s)\nbeing not significant.] However, you can also\nsee the next observation.\n• The trailing zero(s) in a number with a\ndecimal point are significant.\n[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four\nsignificant figures each.]\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the\ntrailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to\nbe 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here\nare meant to convey the precision of\nmeasurement and are, therefore, significant. [If\nthese were not, it would be superfluous to write\nthem explicitly, the reported measurement\nwould have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose\nwe change units, then\n4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km\nSince the last number has trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber with no decimal, we would conclude\nerroneously from observation (1) above that the\nnumber has  two  significant figures, while in\nfact, it has four significant figures and a mere\nchange of units cannot change the number of\nsignificant figures.\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in\ndetermining the number of significant\nfigures, the best way is to report every\nmeasurement in scientific notation (in the\npower of 10). In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a × 10 b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a\n≤ 5) and to 10\n(for 5< a ≤ 10). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10 b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10 b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28×107m) is of the order of 10 7m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06 ×10–10m) is of the order of\n10 –10m, with the order of magnitude\n–10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in\n(a) above disappears :\n4.700 m = 4.700 × 102 cm\n= 4.700 × 103 mm = 4.700 × 10–3 km\nThe power of 10 is irrelevant to the\ndetermination of significant figures. However, all\nzeroes appearing in the base number in the\nscientific notation are significant. Each number\nin this case has four significant figures.\nThus, in the scientific notation, no confusion\narises about the trailing zero(s) in the base\nnumber a. They are always significant.\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting\nmeasurement. But if this is not adopted, we use\nthe rules adopted in the preceding example :\n• For a number greater than 1, without any\ndecimal, the trailing zero(s) are not\nsignificant.\n• For a number with a decimal, the trailing\nzero(s) are significant.\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a\ndecimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)\nis never significant. However, the zeroes at the\nend of such number are significant in a\nmeasurement.\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are\nneither rounded numbers nor numbers\nrepresenting measured values are exact and\nhave infinite number of significant digits. For\nexample in\n2\ndr =  or  s = 2πr, the factor 2 is an\nexact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 5\nor 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in\ntT n= , n is\nan exact number.",

    "content": "1.3.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with\nSignificant Figures\nThe result of a calculation involving approximate\nmeasured values of quantities (i.e. values with\nlimited number of significant figures) must\nreflect the uncertainties in the original\nmeasured values. It cannot be more accurate\nthan the original measured values themselves\non which the result is based. In general, the\nfinal result should not have more significant\nfigures than the original data from which it was\nobtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured\nto be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and\nits volume is measured to be 2.51 cm3, then its\ndensity, by mere arithmetic division, is\n1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal places.\nIt would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to\nrecord the calculated value of density to such a\nprecision when the measurements on which the\nvalue is based, have much less precision. The\nfollowing rules for arithmetic operations with\nsignificant figures ensure that the final result\nof a calculation is shown with the precision that\nis consistent with the precision of the input\nmeasured values :\n(1)  In multiplication or division, the final\nresult should retain as many significant\nfigures as are there in the original number\nwith the least significant figures.\nThus, in the example above, density should\nbe reported to three significant figures.\nDensity\n4.237g\n2.51 cm\n1.69 g cm3\n-3= =\nSimilarly,  if the speed of light is given as\n3.00 × 108 m s -1 (three significant figure) and\none year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 × 107 s (five\nsignificant figures), the light year is 9.47 × 1015 m\n(three significant figures).\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result\nshould retain as many decimal places as are\nthere in the number with the least\ndecimal places.\nFor example, the sum of th e numbers\n436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic\naddition,  is 663.821 g. But the least precise\nmeasurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one\ndecimal place. The final result should, therefore,\nbe rounded off to 663.8 g.\nSimilarly, the difference in length can be\nexpressed as :\n0.307 m – 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 ×10–3 m.\nNote that we should not use the rule (1) applicable\nfor multiplication and division and write 664 g as\nthe result in the example of addition  and\n3.00 × 10–3 m in the example of subtraction. They\ndo not convey the precision of measurement\nproperly. For addition and subtraction, the rule\nis in terms of decimal places.",

The rule by convention is that the\npreceding digit is raised by 1 if the\ninsignificant digit to be dropped (the\nunderlined digit in this case)  is more than\n5, and is left  unchanged if the latter is less\nthan 5 .  But what if the number is 2.74\n5 in\nwhich the insignificant digit is 5.  Here, the\nconvention is that if the preceding digit is\neven, the insignificant digit is simply\ndropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit\nis raised by 1. Then, the number 2.74\n5 rounded\noff to three significant figures becomes 1.74.  On\nthe other hand, the number 2.73\n5 rounded off\nto three significant figures becomes 1.74 since\nthe preceding digit is odd.\nIn any involved or complex multi-step\ncalculation, you should retain, in intermediate\nsteps, one digit more than the significant digits\nand round off to proper significant figures at the\nend of the calculation.  Similarly, a number\nknown to be within many significant figures,\nsuch as in 2.99792458  × 108 m/s for the speed\nof light in vacuum, is rounded off to an\napproximate value 3 × 108 m/s , which is often\nemployed in computations.  Finally, remember\nthat exact numbers that appear in formulae like\n2 π in\nT L\ng\n= 2π , have a large (infinite) number\nPHYSICS6\n⊳\n⊳\nof significant figures. The value of π =\n3.1415926.... is known to a large number of\nsignificant figures. You may take the  value as\n3.142 or 3.14 for π, with limited number of\nsignificant figures as required in specific\ncases.",

It means that the length l may\nbe written as\nl = 16.2 ± 0.1  cm\n= 16.2 cm ± 0.6 %.\nSimilarly, the breadth b may be written as\nb = 10.1  ± 0.1 cm\n= 10.1 cm ± 1 %\nThen, the error of the product of two (or more)\nexperimental values, using the combination of\nerrors rule, will be\nl b = 163.62 cm2\n+ 1.6%\n= 163.62 + 2.6 cm2\nThis leads us to quote the final result as\nl b = 164 + 3 cm2\nHere 3 cm 2 is the uncertainty or error in the\nestimation of area of rectangular sheet.\n(2) If a set of experimental data is specified\nto n significant figures, a result obtained by\ncombining the data will also be valid to n\nsignificant figures.\nHowever, if data are subtracted, the number of\nsignificant figures can be reduced.\nFor example, 12.9 g – 7.06 g, both specified to\nthree significant figures, cannot properly be\nevaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as\nuncertainties in subtraction or addition combine\nin a different fashion (smallest number of\ndecimal places rather than the number of\nsignificant figures in any of the number added\nor subtracted).\n(3) The relative error of a value of number\nspecified to significant figures depends not\nonly on n but also on the number itself.\nFor example,  the accuracy  in measurement of\nmass 1.02 g is ± 0.0 1 g  whereas another\nmeasurement 9.89 g is also accurate to  ± 0.01 g.\nThe relative error in 1.02 g is\n= (± 0.01/1.02) × 100 %\n= ± 1%\nSimilarly, the relative error in 9.89 g  is\n= (± 0.01/9.89) × 100 %\n= ± 0.1 %\nFinally, remember that intermediate results in\na multi-step computation should be\ncalculated to one more significant figure in\nevery measurement than the number of\ndigits in the least precise measurement.\nThese should be justified by the data and then\nthe arithmetic operations may be carried out;\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 7\notherwise rounding errors can build up. For\nexample, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after\nrounding off) to the same number of significant\nfigures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of\n0.104 calculated to three significant figures is\n9.62.  However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044\nand then taken the reciprocal to three significant\nfigures, we would have retrieved the original\nvalue of 9.58.\nThis example justifies the idea to retain one\nmore extra digit (than the number of digits in\nthe least precise measurement) in intermediate\nsteps of the complex multi-step calculations in\norder to avoid additional errors in the process\nof rounding off the numbers.",

All the physical quantities\nrepresented by derived units can be expressed\nin terms of some combination of seven\nfundamental or base quantities.

Thus, length has the\ndimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current\n[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous\nintensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].\nThe dimensions of a physical quantity are the\npowers (or exponents) to which the base\nquantities are raised to represent that\nquantity. Note that using the square brackets\n[  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing\nwith ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.\nIn mechanics, all the physical quantities can\nbe written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]\nand [T]. For example, the volume occupied by\nan object is expressed as the product of length,\nbreadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the\ndimensions of volume are [L] × [L] × [L] = [L]3 = [L3].\nAs the volume is independent of mass and time,\nit is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°],\nzero dimension in time [T°] and three\ndimensions in length.\nSimilarly, force, as the product of mass and\nacceleration, can be expressed as\nForce   = mass × acceleration\n= mass × (length)/(time)2\nThe dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T] 2 =\n[M L T–2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in\nmass, one dimension in length, and –2\ndimensions in time. The dimensions in all other\nbase quantities are zero.\nNote that in this type of representation, the\nmagnitudes are not considered. It is the quality\nof the type of the physical quantity that enters.\nThus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,\naverage velocity, final velocity, and speed are\nall equivalent in this context. Since all these\nquantities can be expressed as length/time,\ntheir dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T–1].",

In other\nwords, we can add or subtract similar physical\nquantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to\nforce, or an electric current cannot be subtracted\nfrom the thermodynamic temperature. This\nsimple principle called the principle of\nhomogeneity of dimensions in an equation is\nextremely useful in checking the correctness of\nan equation.  If the dimensions of all the terms\nare not same, the equation is wrong.  Hence, if\nwe derive an expression for the length (or\ndistance) of an object, regardless of the symbols\nappearing in the original mathematical relation,\nwhen all the individual dimensions are\nsimplified, the remaining dimension must be\nthat of length.  Similarly, if we derive an equation\nof speed, the dimensions on both the sides of\nequation, when simplified, must be of length/\ntime, or [L T–1].\nDimensions are customarily used as a\npreliminary test of the consistency of an\nequation, when there is some doubt about the\ncorr ectness of the equation. However , the\ndimensional consistency does not guarantee\ncorrect equations. It is uncertain to the extent\nof dimensionless quantities or functions. The\narguments of special functions, such as the\ntrigonometric, logarithmic and exponential\nfunctions must be dimensionless. A pure\nnumber, ratio of similar physical quantities,\nsuch as angle as the ratio (length/length),\nrefractive index as the ratio (speed of light in\nvacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no\ndimensions.\nNow we can test the dimensional consistency\nor homogeneity of the equation\n( )\n21/2  0 0x x v  t a t= + +\nfor the distance x travelled by a particle or body\nin time t which starts from the position x0 with\nan initial velocity v0 at time t = 0 and has uniform\nacceleration a along the direction of motion.\nThe dimensions of each term may be written as\n[x] = [L]\n[x0 ] = [L]\n[v0 t] = [L T–1]  [T]\n= [L]\n[(1/2) a t2] = [L T–2] [T2]\n= [L]\nAs each term on the right hand side of this\nequation has the same dimension, namely that\nof length, which is same as the dimension of\nleft hand side of the equation, hence this\nequation is a dimensionally correct equation.\nIt may be noted that a test of consistency of\ndimensions tells us no more and no less than a\ntest of consistency of units, but has the\nadvantage that we need not commit ourselves\nto a particular choice of units, and we need not\nworry about conversions among multiples and\nsub-multiples of the units.  It may be borne in\nmind that if an equation fails this consistency\ntest, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is\nnot proved right.

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as\nlength, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,\nand luminous intensity).\n2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m\nfor metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific\nnotation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify\nmeasurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision\nof the numbers.\n8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical\nquantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for\nexpressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the\nrelationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired\nunits are obtained.\n10.

    "content": "2.1  INTRODUCTION\nMotion is common to everything in the universe. W e walk,\nrun and ride a bicycle.  Even when we are sleeping, air moves\ninto and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and\nveins.  We see leaves falling fr om trees and water flowing\ndown a dam.  Automobiles and planes carry people from one\nplace to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four\nhours and revolves round the sun once in a year . The sun\nitself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving\nwithin its local group of galaxies.\nMotion is change in position of an object with time. How\ndoes the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall\nlearn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the\nconcepts of velocity and acceleration. W e shall confine\nourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight\nline, also known as rectilinear motion . For the case of\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple\nequations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative\nnature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.\nIn our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as\npoint objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size\nof the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a\nreasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations\nin real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can\nbe considered as point-like objects without much error.\nIn Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without\ngoing into the causes of motion. What causes motion\ndescribed in this chapter and the next chapter forms the\nsubject matter of Chapter 4.\nPHYSICS14",

    "content": "2.2  INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED\nThe average velocity tells us how fast an object\nhas been moving over a given time interval but\ndoes not tell us how fast it moves at different\ninstants of time during that interval.  For this,\nwe define  instantaneous velocity  or simply\nvelocity v at an instant t.\nThe velocity at an instant is defined as the\nlimit of the average velocity as the time interval\n∆t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,\nv lim\nx\nt\n=\nt  0∆\n∆\n∆→\n(2.1a)\n=\nd\nd\nx\nt\n(2.1b)\nwhere the symbol lim\nt 0∆ →  stands for the operation\nof taking limit as  ∆tg0 of the quantity on its\nright. In the language of calculus, the quantity\non the right hand side of Eq. (2.1a) is the\ndifferential coefficient of x with respect to t and\nis denoted by\nd\nd\nx\nt\n(see Appendix 2.1).  It is the\nrate of change of position with respect to time,\nat that instant.\nWe can use Eq. (2.1a) for obtaining the\nvalue of velocity at an instant either\ngraphically  or numerically . Suppose that we\nwant to obtain graphically the value of\nvelocity at time  t = 4 s  (point P) for the motion\nof the car represented in Fig.2.1 calculation.\nLet us take ∆t = 2 s centred at t = 4 s. Then,\nby the definition of the average velocity, the\nslope of line P 1P2  ( Fig. 2.1) gives the value of\naverage velocity over the interval   3 s to 5 s.\nFig. 2.1 Determining velocity from position-time\ngraph.  Velocity at t = 4 s is the slope of the\ntangent to the graph at that instant.\nNow, we decrease the value of ∆t from 2 s to 1\ns.  Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2   and its slope\ngives the value of the average velocity over\nthe interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit ∆t → 0,\nthe line P1P2 becomes tangent to the position-\ntime curve at the point P and the velocity at t\n= 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at\nthat point. It is difficult to show this\nprocess graphically. But if we use\nnumerical method to obtain the value of\nthe velocity, the  meaning of the limiting\nprocess becomes clear. For the graph shown\nin Fig. 2. 1, x = 0.08 t3.  Table 2.1 gives the\nvalue of ∆x/∆t calculated for ∆t equal to 2.0 s,\n1.0 s, 0.5 s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t =\n4.0 s. The second and third columns give the\nvalue of t1=\nt\nt\n2\n−\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∆\nand t t\nt\n2\n2 = +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∆\nand the\nfourth and the fifth columns give the\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 15\n⊳\ncorresponding values of x, i.e. x (t1) = 0.08 t1\n3\nand x (t2) = 0.08 t 2\n3. The sixth column lists the\ndifference ∆x = x (t2) –  x (t1) and the last\ncolumn gives the ratio of ∆x and ∆t, i.e. the\naverage velocity corresponding to the value\nof ∆t listed in the first column.\nWe see fr om Table 2.1 that as we decr ease\nthe value of ∆t from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of\nthe average velocity approaches the limiting\nvalue 3.84 m s–1 which is the value of velocity at\nt = 4.0 s, i.e. the value of\ndx\ndt  at t = 4.0 s. In this\nmanner, we can calculate velocity at each\ninstant for motion of the car.\nThe graphical method for the determination\nof the instantaneous velocity is always not a\nconvenient method.  For this, we must carefully\nplot the position–time graph and calculate the\nvalue of average velocity as ∆t becomes smaller\nand smaller.  It is easier to calculate the value\nof velocity at different instants if we have data\nof positions at different instants or exact\nexpression for the position as a function of time.\nThen, we calculate ∆x/∆t from the data for\ndecreasing the value of ∆t and find the limiting\nvalue as we have done in Table 2.1 or use\ndifferential calculus for the given expression and\ncalculate\ndx\ndt  at different instants as done in\nthe following example.",

    "content": "2.3  ACCELERATION\nThe velocity of an object, in general, changes\nduring its course of motion. How to describe\nthis change? Should it be described as the rate\nof change in velocity with distance or with\ntime\n?   This was a problem even in Galileo’s\ntime. It was first thought that this change could\nbe described by the rate of change of velocity\nwith distance. But, through his studies of\nmotion of freely falling objects and motion of\nobjects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded\nthat the rate of change of velocity with time is\na constant of motion for all objects in free fall.\nOn the other hand, the change in velocity with\ndistance is not constant – it decreases with the\nincreasing distance of fall . This led to the\nconcept of acceleration as the rate of change\nof velocity with time.\nThe average acceleration\na  over a time interval\nis defined as the change of velocity divided by\nthe time interval :\n2 1\n2 1\n–\n–\nv v va\nt t t\n∆= = ∆\n(2.2)\nwhere v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities\nor simply velocities at time  t2\nand t1\n. It is the\naverage change of velocity per unit time. The SI\nunit of acceleration is m s–2 .\nOn a plot of velocity versus time, the average\nacceleration is the slope of the straight line\nconnecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)\nand (v1, t1).\nPHYSICS16\nFig. 2. 3 Velocity–time graph for motions with\nconstant acceleration. (a) Motion in positive\ndirection with positive acceleration,\n(b) Motion in positive direction with\nnegative acceleration, (c) Motion in\nnegative direction with negative\nacceleration, (d) Motion of an object with\nnegative acceleration that changes\ndirection at time t1.  Between times 0 to\nt1, it moves in  positive x - direction\nand between t 1 and t 2 it moves in the\nopposite direction.\nInstantaneous acceleration is defined in the\nsame way as the instantaneous velocity :\nd\ndt 0\nv va lim t tΔ →\nΔ= = Δ (2.3)\nThe acceleration at an instant is the slope\nof the tangent to the v–t  curve at that\ninstant.\nSince velocity is a quantity having both\nmagnitude and direction, a change in\nvelocity may involve either or both of these\nfactors.  Acceleration, therefore, may result\nfrom a change in speed (magnitude), a\nchange in direction or changes in both.  Like\nvelocity, acceleration can also be positive,\nnegative or zero.  Position-time graphs for\nmotion with positive, negative and zero\nacceleration are shown in Figs. 2. 4 (a), (b)\nand (c), respectively.  Note that the graph\ncurves upward for positive acceleration;\ndownward for negative acceleration and it is\na straight line for zero acceleration.\nAlthough acceleration can vary with time,\nour study in this chapter will be restricted\nto motion with constant acceleration. In this\ncase, the average acceleration equals the\nconstant value of acceleration during the\ninterval. If the velocity of an object is vo at t\n= 0 and v at time t, we have\nor0\n0\n0\nv va   ,  v v a tt\n−= = +−         (2.4)\nFig. 2.2 Position-time graph for motion with\n(a) positive acceleration; (b) negative\nacceleration, and (c) zero acceleration.\nLet us see how velocity-time graph looks like\nfor some simple cases. Fig. 2.3 shows     velocity-\ntime graph for motion with constant acceleration\nfor the following cases :\n(a) An object is moving in a positive direction\nwith a positive acceleration.\n(b) An object is moving in positive direction\nwith a negative acceleration.\n(c) An object is moving in negative direction\nwith a negative acceleration.\n(d) An object is moving in positive direction\ntill time t1, and then turns back with the\nsame negative acceleration.\nAn interesting feature of a velocity-time\ngraph for any moving object is that  the area\nunder the curve represents the\ndisplacement over a given time interval . A\ngeneral proof of this statement requires use of\ncalculus. We can, however , see that it is true\nfor the simple case of an object moving with\nconstant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is\nas shown in Fig. 2.4.\nMOTION IN A STRAIGHT LINE 17\nFig. 2.4 Area under v–t curve equals displacement\nof the object over a given time interval.\nThe v-t curve is\na straight line parallel to the\ntime axis and the area under it between t = 0\nand t = T\nis the area of the rectangle of height u\nand base T. Therefore, area = u × T = uT which\nis the displacement in this time interval.  How\ncome in this case an area is equal to a distance?\nThink!

    "content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify\nthis choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.\n2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is\ndecreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This\nstatement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.\n3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or\ndecreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice\nof the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is\nchosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is\nnegative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,\nresults in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative\nacceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.\n4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration\nat that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.\nFor example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the\nacceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.\n5. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic,\ni.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations\n(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different\nquantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.\n6. The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3)) are\nexact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (2.9)) are true only for\nmotion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during\nthe course of motion.\nPHYSICS24",

W e\nfound that the directional aspect of these quantities can be\ntaken care of by + and – signs, as in one dimension only two\ndirections are possible. But in order to describe motion of an\nobject in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions\n(space), we need to use vectors to describe the above-\nmentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary\nto learn the language of vectors. What is a vecto r? How to\nadd, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of\nmultiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this\nto enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and\nacceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object\nin a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall\ndiscuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail\nthe projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of\nmotion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.\nWe shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.\nThe equations developed in this chapter for motion in a\nplane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.",

For example,\nif the length and breadth of a rectangle are\n1.0 m and 0.5 m  respectively , then its\nperimeter is the sum of the lengths of the\nfour sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =\n3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar\nand the perimeter is also a scalar . T ake\nanother example: the maximum and\nminimum temperatures on a particular day\nare 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C  respectively.  Then,\nthe difference between the two temperatures\nis 11.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube\nof aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of\n2.7 kg, then its volume is 10 –3 m 3 (a scalar)\nand its density is 2.7 ×103 kg m –3 (a scalar).\nA vector quantity is a quantity that has both\na magnitude and a direction and obeys the\ntriangle law of addition  or equivalently the\nparallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is\nspecified by giving its magnitude by a number\nand its direction. Some physical quantities that\nare represented by vectors are displacement,\nvelocity, acceleration and force.\nTo represent a vector, we use a bold face type\nin this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be\nrepresented by a symbol v.  Since bold face is\ndifficult to produce, when written by hand, a\nvector is often represented by an arrow placed\nover a letter , say\n/arrowrightnospv . Thus, both v and\n/arrowrightnospv\nrepresent the velocity vector. The magnitude of\na vector is often called its absolute value,\nindicated by | v| = v.  Thus, a vector is\nrepresented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...\nx, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light\nface A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.",

We shall now\ndescribe this law of addition using the graphical\nmethod. Let us consider two vectors A and B that\nlie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a).  The lengths\nof the line segments representing these vectors\nare proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.\nTo find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that\nits tail is at the head of the vector A, as in\nFig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head\nof B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is,\nthe sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this\nprocedure of vector addition, vectors are\nFig. 3.2   (a) Two equal vectors A and B.

If we find the resultant of\nB + A as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector R is\nobtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative:\nA + B = B + A (3.1)\nThe addition of vectors also obeys the associative\nlaw as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of\nadding vectors A and B first and then adding\nvector C is the same as the result of adding B\nand C first and then adding vector A :\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (3.2)\nWhat is the result of adding two equal and\nopposite vectors ?

Their sum is A + (–A).\nSince the magnitudes of the two vectors are the\nsame, but the directions are opposite, the\nresultant vector has zero magnitude and is\nrepresented by 0 called a null vector or a zero\nvector :\nA – A = 0         |0|= 0 (3.3)\nSince the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its\ndirection cannot be specified.\nThe null vector also results when we multiply\na vector A by the number zero. The main\nproperties of 0 are :\nA + 0 = A\nλ 0 = 0\n0 A = 0        (3.4)\nFig. 3.5 (a) Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B\nfrom vector A – the result is R2. For\ncomparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R1 is also shown.\nWhat is the physical meaning of a zero vector?\nConsider the position and displacement vectors\nin a plane as shown in Fig. 3.1(a). Now suppose\nthat an object which is at P at time t, moves to\nP′ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its\ndisplacement? Since the initial and final\npositions coincide, the displacement is a “null\nvector”.\nSubtraction of vectors can be defined in terms\nof addition of vectors. We define the difference\nof two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors\nA and –B :\nA – B = A + (–B) (3.5)\nIt is shown in Fig 3.5. The vector –B is added to\nvector A to get R2 = (A – B). The vector R1 = A + B\nis also shown in the same figure for comparison.\nWe can also use the parallelogram method to\nfind the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have\ntwo vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we\nbring their tails to a common origin O as\nshown in Fig. 3.6(a). Then we draw a line from\nthe head of A parallel to B and another line from\nthe head of B parallel to A to complete a\nparallelogram OQSP.  Now we join the point of\nthe intersection of these two lines to the origin\nO. The resultant vector R is directed from the\ncommon origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the\nparallelogram  [ Fig. 3.6 (b)]. In Fig.3.6 (c), the\ntriangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A\nand B and we see that the two methods yield the\nsame result. Thus, the two methods are\nequivalent.\nMOTION IN A PLANE 31\n⊳Example 3.1 Rain is falling vertically with\na speed of 35 m s–1.

    "content": "3.5  RESOLUTION OF VECTORS\nLet a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a\nplane with different directions and let A be\nanother vector in the same plane (Fig. 3.8). A\ncan be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one\nobtained by multiplying a by a real number and\nthe other obtained by multiplying b by another\nreal number. To see this, let O and P be the tail\nand head of the vector A. Then, through O, draw\na straight line parallel to a, and thr ough P, a\nstraight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at\nQ. Then, we have\nA = OP  = OQ + QP (3.6)\nBut since OQ is parallel to a, and QP is parallel\nto b, we can write :\nOQ =\nλ a, and QP = µ b (3.7)\nwhere  λ and µ are real numbers.\nTherefore, A = λ a + µ b (3.8)\nFig. 3.8  (a) Two non-colinear vectors a and b.\n(b) Resolving a vector A in terms of vectors\na and b.\nWe say that A has been r esolved into two\ncomponent vectors λ a and µ b along a and b\nPHYSICS32\nFig. 3.9 (a) Unit vectors  ɵi  , ɵj and ɵk lie along the x-, y-, and z-axes. (b) A vector A is resolved into its\ncomponents Ax and Ay along x-, and y- axes. (c) A1 and  A2 expressed in terms of ɵi and ɵj.\nrespectively. Using this method one can resolve\na given vector into two component vectors along\na set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same\nplane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector\nalong the axes of a rectangular coordinate\nsystem using vectors of unit magnitude. These\nare called unit vectors  that we discuss now. A\nunit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and\npoints in a particular direction. It has no\ndimension and unit. It is used to specify a\ndirection only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and\nz-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are\ndenoted by\nɵi, ɵj and ˆk , respectively, as shown\nin Fig. 3.9(a).\nSince these are unit vectors, we have\n\nˆi   = ˆj =  ˆk=1 (3.9)\nThese unit vectors are perpendicular to each\nother. In this text, they are printed in bold face\nwith a cap (^) to distinguish them from other\nvectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two\ndimensions in this chapter , we require use of\nonly two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector,\nsay\nˆn by a scalar, the result is a vector\nλ λλ λλ = λ ˆn.  In general, a vector A can be written as\nA = |A| ˆn (3.10)\nwhere ˆn is a unit vector along A.\nWe can now resolve a vector A in terms\nof component vectors that lie along unit vectors\niˆ and ɵj.  Consider a vector A that lies in x-y\nplane as shown in Fig. 3.9(b). We draw lines from\nthe head of A perpendicular to the coordinate\naxes as in Fig. 3.9(b), and get vectors A1 and A2\nsuch that  A1 + A2 = A. Since A1 is parallel to  ɵi\nand A2 is parallel to ɵj,  we have :\nA1= Ax ɵi,  A2 = Ay\nɵj (3.11)\nwhere Ax  and  Ay are real numbers.\nThus,    A = Ax\nɵi+ Ay ɵj              (3.12)\nThis is represented in Fig. 3.9(c). The quantities\nAx  and Ay  are called x-, and y- components of the\nvector A. Note that Ax is itself not a vector, but\nAx\nɵi  is a vector , and so is Ay\nɵj. Using simple\ntrigonometry, we can express Ax   and Ay in terms\nof the magnitude of A and the angle θ it makes\nwith the x-axis :\nAx  = A cos θ\nAy = A sin θ (3.13)\nAs is clear from Eq. (3.13), a component of a\nvector can be positive, negative or zero\ndepending on the value of\nθ.\nNow, we have two ways to specify a vector A\nin a plane. It can be specified by :\n(i) its magnitude A and the direction θ it makes\nwith the x-axis; or\n(ii) its components Ax and Ay\nIf A and θ  are given,  Ax and Ay  can be obtained\nusing Eq. (3.13). If Ax  and Ay   are given, A and\nθ\ncan be obtained as follows :\nA A A Ax\n2\ny\n2 2 2 2 2+ = + cos sinθ θ\n= A2\nOr, A A A x\n2\ny\n2= +      (3.14)\nAnd tan , tanθ θ= = −A\nA\nA\nA\ny\nx\ny\nx\n1\n(3.15)\nMOTION IN A PLANE 33\n⊳\nB i j= +B Bx y\nɵ ɵ\nLet R be their sum. We have\nR = A + B\n( ) ( )= + + +A A B Bx y x y\nɵ ɵ ɵ ɵi j i j (3.19a)\nSince vectors obey the commutative and\nassociative laws, we can arrange and regroup\nthe vectors in Eq. (3.19a) as convenient to us :\n( ) ( )R i j= + + +A B A Bx x y y\nɵ ɵ (3.19b)\nSinceR i j= +R Rx y\nɵ ɵ (3.20)\nwe have, x x x y y yR A B ,  R A B  = + = + (3.21)\nThus, each component of the resultant\nvector R is the sum of the corresponding\ncomponents of A and B.\nIn three dimensions, we have\nA i j k= + +A A Ax y z\nɵ ɵ ɵ\nB i j k= + +B B Bx y z\nɵ ɵ ɵ\nR A B i j k= + = + + R R Rx y z\nɵ ɵ ɵ\nwith R A Bx x x= +\nR A By y y= +\nR A Bz z z= + (3.22)\nThis method can be extended to addition and\nsubtraction of any number of vectors.

P1, P2 and\nP3 represent the positions of the object  after\ntimes ∆t1,∆t2, and ∆t3. ∆r1,  ∆r2, and ∆r3 are the\ndisplacements of the object in times  ∆t1, ∆t2, and\nFig. 3.13 As the time interval ∆t approaches zero, the average velocity approaches the velocity v.

    "content": "3.9  PROJECTILE MOTION\nAs an application of the ideas developed in the\nprevious sections, we consider the motion of a\nprojectile. An object that is in flight after being\nthrown or projected is called a projectile.  Such\na projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a\nbaseball or any other object. The motion of a\nprojectile may be thought of as the result of two\nseparate, simultaneously occurring components\nof motions. One component is along a horizontal\ndirection without  any acceleration and the other\nalong the vertical direction with constant\nacceleration due to the force of gravity. It was\nGalileo who first stated this independency of the\nhorizontal and the vertical components of\nprojectile motion in his Dialogue on the great\nworld systems (1632).\nIn our discussion, we shall assume that the\nair resistance has negligible effect on the motion\nof the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is\nlaunched with velocity vo that makes an angle\nθo with  the x-axis as shown in Fig. 3.16.\nAfter the object has been projected, the\nacceleration acting on it is that due to gravity\nwhich is directed vertically downward:\na j= −g ɵ\nOr, ax = 0, ay = – g       (3.35)\nThe components of initial velocity vo are :\nvox = vo cos θo\nvoy= vo sin θo       (3.36)\n⊳\nr r v v v a v\n0\n0 0 0− = +\n\n\n = +( ) +\n\n\n2 2t t t\n21\n2t t= + 0v a\nOr, r r v a0 0= + + t t 1\n2\n2 (3.34a)\nIt can be easily verified that the derivative of\nEq. (3.34a), i.e. d\nd\nr\nt  gives Eq.(3.33a) and it also\nsatisfies the condition that at  t =0, r = ro.\nEquation (3.34a) can be written in component\nform as\nx x v t a t ox x= + +0\n21\n2\n21\n2\n0 oy yy y v t a t= + + (3.34b)\nOne immediate interpretation of Eq.(3.34b) is that\nthe  motions in x- and y-directions can be treated\nindependently of each other.  That is, motion in\na plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two\nseparate simultaneous one-dimensional\nmotions with constant acceleration along two\nperpendicular directions.  This is an important\nresult and is useful in analysing motion of objects\nin two dimensions. A similar result holds for three\ndimensions. The choice of perpendicular\ndirections is convenient in many physical\nsituations, as we shall see in section 3. 9 for\nprojectile motion.",

    "content": "3.10  UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION\nWhen an object follows a circular path at a\nconstant speed, the motion of the object is called\nuniform circular motion.  The word “uniform”\nrefers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)\nthroughout the motion.  Suppose an object is\nmoving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius\nR as shown in Fig. 3.18. Since the velocity of the\nobject is changing continuously in direction, the\nobject undergoes acceleration. Let us find the\nmagnitude and the direction of this acceleration.\nMOTION IN A PLANE 41\nLet r and r′ be the position vectors and v and\nv′ the velocities of the object when it is at point P\nand P′ as shown in Fig. 3.18(a).  By definition,\nvelocity at a point is along the tangent at that\npoint in the direction of motion. The velocity\nvectors v\nand v′ are as shown in Fig. 3.18(a1).\n∆v is obtained in Fig. 3.18 (a2) using the triangle\nlaw of vector addition. Since the path is circular,\nv is perpendicular to r and so is v′ to r′.\nTherefore, ∆ v is perpendicular to ∆r. Since\naverage acceleration is along ∆v a\nv\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∆\n∆t\n, the\naverage acceleration a  is perpendicular to ∆r. If\nwe place ∆v on the line that bisects the angle\nbetween r and r′, we see that it is directed towards\nthe centre of the circle. Figure 3.18(b) shows the\nsame quantities for smaller time interval. ∆v and\nhence a  is again directed towards the centre.\nIn Fig. 3.18(c), ∆t 0 and the average\nacceleration becomes the instantaneous\nacceleration. It is directed towards the centre*.\nThus, we find that the acceleration of an object\nin uniform circular motion is always directed\ntowards the centre of the circle. Let us now find\nthe magnitude of the acceleration.\nThe magnitude of a is, by definition, given by\na v= → ∆\n∆\n∆t 0 t\nLet the angle between position vectors r and\nr′ be ∆θ.   Since the velocity vectors v and v′ are\nalways perpendicular to the position vectors, the\nangle between them is also ∆θ . Therefore, the\ntriangle CPP′ formed by the position vectors and\nthe triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors\nv, v′ and ∆v are similar (Fig. 3.18a).  Therefore,\nthe ratio of the base-length to side-length for\none of the triangles is equal to that of the other\ntriangle. That is :\n∆ ∆v r\nv R\n=\nOr, ∆\n∆\nv\nr\n= v\nR\nTherefore,\na\nv r r\n=\n→\n=\n→\n=\n→∆\n∆\n∆ ∆\n∆\n∆ ∆\n∆\n∆t 0 0 R R 0t t\nv\nt\nv\nt t\nIf ∆t is small, ∆θ will also be small and then arc\nPP′ can be approximately taken to be|∆r|:\n∆ ∆r ≅ v t\n∆\n∆\nr\nt v≅\nOr, ∆\n∆\n∆t 0 t\nv\n→\n=\nr\nTherefore, the centripetal acceleration ac is :\nFig. 3.18 Velocity and acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion.  The time interval ∆t decreases from\n(a) to (c) where it is zero.  The acceleration is directed, at each point of the path, towards the centre of\nthe circle.\n* In the limit ∆t0, ∆r becomes perpendicular to r. In this limit ∆v→ 0 and is consequently also perpendicular\nto  V. Therefore, the acceleration is directed towards the centre, at each point of the circular path.\nlim\nlimlim lim\nlim\nPHYSICS42\n⊳\nac  =\nv\nR\n \n   v = v2/R (3.43)\nThus, the acceleration of an object moving with\nspeed v in a circle of radius R has a magnitude\nv\n2\n/R\nand is always directed towards the centre.\nThis is why this acceleration is called centripetal\nacceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A\nthorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was\nfirst published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist\nChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was\nprobably known to Newton also some years earlier.\n“Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means\n‘centre-seeking’.  Since v and R are constant, the\nmagnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also\nconstant. However , the dir ection changes —\npointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a\ncentripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.\nWe have another way of describing the\nvelocity and the acceleration of an object  in\nuniform circular motion.  As the object moves\nfrom P to P ′ in time Δt (= t ′ – t), the line CP\n(Fig. 3.18) turns through an angle Δ\nθ  as shown\nin the figure. Δθ  is called angular distance.  We\ndefine the angular speed ω (Greek letter omega)\nas the time rate of change of angular\ndisplacement :\nω θ\n=\nΔ\nΔt      (3.44)\nNow, if the distance travelled by the object\nduring the time Δt is Δs, i.e. PP\n′ is Δs, then :\nv s\nt= Δ\nΔ\nbut Δs = R Δθ. Therefore :\nv R\nt\n= =\nΔ\nΔ\nθ ωR\nv =  R ω (3.45)\nWe can expr ess centripetal acceleration ac in\nterms of angular speed :\na\nv\nR\nR\nR\nRc = = =\n2 2\n2ω\nω\n2\na Rc = ω 2 (3.46)\nThe time taken by an object to make one revolution\nis known as its time period T and the number of\nrevolution made in one second is called its\nfrequency ν (=1/T).  However, during this time\nthe distance moved by the object is s = 2πR.\nTherefore, v = 2πR/T =2πRν (3.47)\nIn terms of frequency ν, we have\nω = 2πν\nv = 2πRν\nac = 4π2 ν2R                                       (3.48)",

Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and dir ection both.  Examples ar e\ndisplacement, velocity and  acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.\n3. A vector A multiplied by a real number λ  is also a vector, whose magnitude is λ times\nthe magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending\nupon whether λ is positive or negative.\n4. Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram\nmethod.\n5. Vector addition is commutative :\nA + B = B + A\nIt also obeys the associative law :\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)\n6. A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude.  Since the magnitude is zero, we\ndon’t have to specify its direction.  It has the properties :\nA + 0 = A\nλ0 = 0\n0 A = 0\n7. The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B :\nA – B = A+ (–B)\n8. A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the\nsame plane :\nA = λ a + µ b\nwhere λ and µ  are real numbers.\n9. A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:\nˆn A\nA=\nThe unit vectors  ɵ ɵ ɵi, j, k  are vectors of unit magnitude and point in the direction of\nthe x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively in a right-handed coordinate system.\n10.

If an object undergoes a displacement ∆r in time ∆t, its average velocity is given by\nv =\n∆\n∆\nr\nt\n.

An object that is in flight after being projected is called a projectile.

    "content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as\nthe magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the\npath length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are\nequal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all\nother cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.\n2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the\nmagnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the\npath length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.\n3. The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,\nyou can always resolve them along any two independent axes.\n4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform\ncircular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its\ndirection is changing.\n5. An object subjected to two velocities v1 and v2 has a resultant velocity v = v1 + v2. Take\ncare to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v12= v1 − v2.\nHere v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.\n6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if\nthe speed is constant.\n7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration\nalone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial\nvelocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration\ndue to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.",

    "content": "4.1  INTRODUCTION\nIn the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the\nmotion of a particle in space quantitatively. W e saw that\nuniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas\nnon-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in\naddition.  So far, we have not asked the question as to what\ngoverns the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this\nbasic question.\nLet us first guess the answer based on our common\nexperience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.\nTo throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward\npush.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a\nstrong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a\nflowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external\nagency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.\nLikewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop\nmotion.  You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by\napplying a force against the direction of its motion.\nIn these examples, the external agency of force (hands,\nwind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not\nalways necessary. A stone released from the top of a building\naccelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the\nearth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.\nThis shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and\nmagnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a\ndistance.\nIn short, a force is required to put a stationary body in\nmotion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is\nneeded to provide this force. The external agency may or may\nnot be in contact with the body.\nSo far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.\na skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal\nice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in\nuniform motion?\n4.1 Introduction\n4.2 Aristotle’s fallacy\n4.3 The law of inertia\n4.4 Newton’s first law of motion\n4.5 Newton’s second law of\nmotion\n4.6 Newton’s third law of motion\n4.7 Conservation of momentum\n4.8 Equilibrium of a particle\n4.9 Common forces in mechanics\n4.10 Circular motion\n4.11 Solving problems in\nmechanics",

    "content": "4.2  ARISTOTLE’S  FALLACY\nThe question posed above appears to be simple.\nHowever, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the\ncorrect answer to this question given by Galileo\nin the seventeenth century was the foundation\nof Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the\nbirth of modern science.\nThe Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C– 322\nB.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,\nsomething external is required to keep it moving.\nAccording to this view, for example, an arrow\nshot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind\nthe arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of\nan elaborate framework of ideas developed by\nAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.\nMost of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now\nknown to be wrong and need not concern us.\nFor our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of\nmotion may be phrased thus: An external force\nis required  to keep a body in motion.\nAristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall\nsee.  However, it is a natural view that anyone\nwould hold from common experience. Even a\nsmall child playing with a simple (non-electric)\ntoy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs\nto constantly drag the string attached to the toy-\ncar with some force to keep it going.  If it releases\nthe string, it comes to rest. This experience is\ncommon to most terrestrial motion. External\nforces seem to be needed to keep bodies in\nmotion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually\ncome to rest.\nWhat is the flaw in Aristotle’s argument? The\nanswer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because\nthe external force of friction on the car by the floor\nopposes its motion. To counter this force, the child\nhas to apply an external force on the car in the\ndirection of motion.  When the car is in uniform\nmotion, there is no net external force acting on it:\nthe force by the child cancels the force ( friction)\nby the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction,\nthe child would not be required to apply any force\nto keep the toy car in uniform motion.\nThe opposing forces such as friction (solids)\nand viscous forces (for fluids) are always present\nin the natural world.  This explains why forces\nby external agencies are necessary to overcome\nthe frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform\nmotion. Now we understand  where Aristotle\nwent wrong.  He coded this practical experience\nin the form of a basic argument.  To get at the\ntrue law of nature for forces and motion, one has\nto imagine a world in which uniform motion is\npossible with no frictional forces opposing. This\nis what Galileo did.",

    "content": "4.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA\nGalileo studied motion of objects on an inclined\nplane.  Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane\naccelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.\n(iii) Motion on a horizontal plane  is an interme-\ndiate situation.  Galileo concluded that an object\nmoving on a frictionless horizontal plane must\nneither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it\nshould move with constant velocity (Fig. 4.1(a)).\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig. 4.1(a)\nAnother experiment by Galileo leading to the\nsame conclusion involves a double inclined plane.\nA ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls\ndown and climbs up the other. If the planes are\nsmooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the\nsame as the initial height (a little less but never\ngreater). In the ideal situation, when friction is\nabsent, the final height of the ball is the same\nas its initial height.\nIf the slope of the second plane is decreased\nand the experiment repeated, the ball will still\nreach the same height, but in doing so , it will\ntravel a longer distance.  In the limiting case, when\nthe slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a\nhorizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.\nIn other words, its motion never ceases. This is,\nof course, an idealised situation (Fig. 4.1(b)).\nFig. 4.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo\nfrom observations of motion of a ball on a\ndouble inclined plane.\nLAWS OF MOTION 51\nIn practice, the ball does come to a stop after\nmoving a finite distance on the horizontal plane,\nbecause of the opposing force of friction which\ncan never be totally eliminated.  However, if there\nwere no friction, the ball would continue  to move\nwith a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.\nGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on\nmotion that had eluded Aristotle and those who\nfollowed him.  The state of rest and the state of\nuniform linear motion (motion with constant\nvelocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is\nno net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to\nassume that a net force is needed to keep a body\nin uniform motion. To maintain a body in\nuniform motion, we need to apply an external\nforce to ecounter the frictional force, so that\nthe two forces sum up to zero net external\nforce.\nTo summarise, if the net external force is zero,\na body at rest continues to remain at rest and a\nbody in motion continues to move with a uniform\nvelocity.  This property of the body is called\ninertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to  change’.\nA body does not change its state of rest or\nuniform motion, unless an external force\ncompels it to change that state.",

    "content": "4.4  NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION\nGalileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas\ndethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new\nmechanics had to be developed. This task was\nIdeas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science\nAncient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of\nmotion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force\nof wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent\ntendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;\ntransmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps\ncomes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to\nbe opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air\nresistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational\nand vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent\nparticles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational\nand vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a\ndefinite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of\nmotion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be\nindicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept\nof ‘instantaneous motion’ ( tatkaliki gati ), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous\nvelocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly\nunderstood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results\nfrom the transmission of vibrations of water particles.\naccomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac\nNewton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.\nNewton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the\nfoundation of mechanics in terms of three laws\nof  motion that go by his name.  Galileo’s law of\ninertia was his starting point which he formu-\nlated as the first law of motion:\nEvery body continues to be in its state\nof rest or of uniform motion in a straight\nline unless compelled by some external\nforce to act otherwise.\nThe state of rest or uniform linear motion both\nimply zero acceleration. The first law of motion  can,\ntherefore, be simply expressed as:\nIf the net external force on a body is zero, its\nacceleration is zero.  Acceleration can be non\nzero only if there is a net external force on\nthe body.\nTwo kinds of situations are encountered in the\napplication of this law in practice. In some\nexamples, we know that the net external force\non the object is zero. In that case we can\nconclude that the acceleration of the object is\nzero.  For example, a spaceship out in\ninterstellar space, far from all other objects and\nwith all its rockets turned off, has no net\nexternal force acting on it.  Its acceleration,\naccording to the first law, must be zero.  If it is\nin motion, it must continue to move with a\nuniform velocity.\nPHYSICS52\n⊳\nMore often, however, we do not know all the\nforces to begin with.  In that case, if we know\nthat an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either\nat rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer\nfrom the first law that the net external force on\nthe object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere.\nFor terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every\nobject experiences gravitational force due to the\nearth.  Also objects in motion generally experience\nfriction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an\nobject is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is\nnot because there are no forces acting on it, but\nbecause the various external forces cancel out\ni.e. add up to zero net external force.\nConsider a book at rest on a horizontal surface\nFig. (4.2(a)).  It is subject to two external forces :\nthe force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting\ndownward and the upward force on the book by\nthe table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting\nforce. This is an example of the kind of situation\nmentioned above. The forces are not quite known\nfully but the state of motion is known. We observe\nthe book to be at rest.  Therefore, we conclude\nfrom the first law that the magnitude of R equals\nthat of W. A statement often encounter ed is :\n“Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book\nis at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct\nstatement is : “Since the book is observed to be at\nrest, the net external force on it must be zero,\naccording to the first law. This implies that the\nnormal force R  must be equal and opposite to the\nweight W ”.\nFig. 4.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car\nmoving with uniform velocity. The net force\nis zero in each case.\nConsider the motion of a car starting from\nrest, picking up speed and then moving on a\nsmooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig.\n(4.2(b)).  When the car is stationary, there is no\nnet force acting on it. During pick-up, it\naccelerates. This must happen due to a net\nexternal force. Note, it has to be an external force.\nThe acceleration of the car cannot be accounted\nfor by any internal force.  This might sound\nsurprising, but it is true.  The only conceivable\nexternal force along the road is the force of\nfriction.  It is the frictional force that accelerates\nthe car as a whole.  (You will learn about friction\nin section 4.9).  When the car moves with\nconstant velocity, there is no net external force.\nThe property of inertia contained in the First\nlaw is evident in many situations.  Suppose we\nare standing in a stationary  bus and the driver\nstarts the bus suddenly. W e get thr own\nbackward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch\nwith the floor. If there were no friction, we would\nremain where we were, while the floor of the bus\nwould simply slip forward under our feet and the\nback of the bus would hit us.  However ,\nfortunately, there is some friction between the\nfeet and the floor.  If the start is not too sudden,\ni.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional\nforce would be enough to accelerate our feet\nalong with the bus.  But our body is not strictly\na rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some\nrelative displacement between different parts.\nWhat this means is that while our feet go with\nthe bus, the rest of the body remains where it is\ndue to inertia.  Relative to the bus, therefore, we\nare thrown backward.  As soon as that happens,\nhowever, the muscular forces on the rest of the\nbody (by the feet) come into play to move the body\nalong with the bus. A similar thing happens\nwhen the bus suddenly stops.  Our feet stop due\nto the friction which does not allow relative\nmotion between the feet and the floor of the bus.\nBut the rest of the body continues to move\nforward due to inertia.  We are thrown forward.\nThe restoring muscular forces again come into\nplay and bring the body to rest.",

One reason is that the cricketer allows a\nlonger time for his hands to stop the ball.  As\nyou may have noticed, he draws in the hands\nbackward in the act of catching the ball\n(Fig. 4.3).  The novice, on the other hand,\nkeeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the\nball almost instantly. He needs to provide a\nmuch greater force to stop the ball instantly,\nand this hurts.  The conclusion is clear: force\nnot only depends on the change in momentum,\nbut also on how fast the change is brought\nabout.  The same change in momentum\nbrought about in a shorter time needs a\ngreater applied force. In short, the greater the\nrate of change of momentum, the greater is\nthe force.\nFig. 4.3 Force not only depends on the change in\nmomentum but also on how fast the change\nis brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws\nin his hands during a catch, allowing greater\ntime for the ball to stop and hence requires a\nsmaller force.\n• Observations confirm that the product of\nmass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to\nthe effect of force on motion.  Suppose a fixed\nforce is applied for a certain interval of time\non two bodies of different masses, initially at\nrest,  the lighter body picks up a greater speed\nthan the heavier body.  However, at the end of\nthe time interval, observations show that each\nbody acquires the same momentum.  Thus\nthe same force for the same time causes\nthe same change in momentum for\ndifferent bodies.  This is a crucial clue to the\nsecond law of motion.\n• In the preceding observations, the vector\nastronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is\nzero.

    "content": "4.5  NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION\nThe first law refers to the simple case when the\nnet external force on a body is zero.  The second\nlaw of motion refers to the general situation when\nthere is a net external force acting on the body.\nIt relates the net external force to the\nacceleration of the body.\nMomentum\nMomentum of a body is defined to be the product\nof its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted\nby p:\np = m v         (4.1)\nMomentum is clearly a vector quantity.  The\nfollowing common experiences indicate the\nimportance of this quantity for considering the\neffect of force on motion.\n• Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small\ncar) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded\ntruck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all\nknow that a much greater force is needed to\npush the truck than the car to bring them to\nthe same speed in same time.  Similarly, a\ngreater opposing force is needed to stop a\nheavy body than a light body in the same time,\nif they are moving with the same speed.\n• If two stones, one light and the other heavy,\nare dropped from the top of a building, a\nperson on the ground will find it easier to catch\nthe light stone than the heavy stone.  The\nmass of a body is thus an important\nparameter that determines the effect of force\non its motion.\n• Speed is another important parameter to\nconsider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily\npierce human tissue before it stops, resulting\nin casualty.  The same bullet fired with\nmoderate speed will not cause much damage.\nThus for a given mass, the greater the speed,\nthe greater is the opposing force needed to stop\nthe body in a certain time.  T aken together,\nthe product of mass and velocity, that is\nmomentum, is evidently a relevant variable\nof motion. The greater the change in the\nmomentum in a given time, the greater is the\nforce that needs to be applied.\n• A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball\ncoming in with great speed far more easily\nthan a novice, who can hurt his hands in the\nPHYSICS54\ncharacter of momentum has not been evident.\nIn the examples so far, momentum and change\nin momentum both have the same direction.\nBut this is not always the case.  Suppose a\nstone is rotated with uniform speed in a\nhorizontal plane by means of a string, the\nmagnitude of momentum is fixed, but its\ndirection changes (Fig. 4.4). A force is needed\nto cause this change in momentum vector .\nThis force is provided by our hand through\nthe string.  Experience suggests that our hand\nneeds to exert a greater force if the stone is\nrotated at greater speed or in a circle of\nsmaller radius, or both. This corresponds to\ngreater acceleration or equivalently a greater\nrate of change in momentum vector . This\nsuggests that the greater the rate of change\nin momentum vector the greater is the force\napplied.\nFig. 4.4 Force is necessary  for changing the direction\nof momentum, even if its magnitude is\nconstant. We can feel this while r otating a\nstone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed\nby means of a string.\nThese qualitative observations lead to the\nsecond law of motion expressed by Newton as\nfollows :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is\ndirectly proportional to the applied force and\ntakes place in the direction in which the force\nacts.\nThus, if under the action of a force F for time\ninterval ∆t, the velocity of a body of mass m\nchanges from v to v + ∆v i.e. its initial momentum\np = mv changes by\nm∆ = ∆p v . According to the\nSecond Law,\nor     kt t\n∆ ∆∝ =∆ ∆\np pF F\nwhere k  is a constant of proportionality.  Taking\nthe limit ∆t → 0,  the term t∆\n∆p  becomes the\nderivative or differential co-efficient of p with\nrespect to t, denoted by d\ndt\np .  Thus\nd\ndk t= pF (4.2)\nFor a body of fixed mass m,\n( )d d d\nd d dm m m t t t= = =p vv a      (4.3)\ni.e the Second Law can also be written as\nF  =   k m a         (4.4)\nwhich shows that force is proportional to the\nproduct of mass\nm and acceleration a.\nThe unit of force has not been defined so far.\nIn fact, we use Eq. (4.4) to define the unit of force.\nWe, therefor e, have the liberty to choose any\nconstant value for k.  For simplicity, we choose\nk = 1. The second law then is\napF  mt     d\nd  = = (4.5)\nIn SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration\nof 1 m s-2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as\nnewton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\nLet us note at this stage some important points\nabout the second law :\n1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0. The second\nlaw is obviously  consistent with the first law.\n2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is\nequivalent to three equations, one for each\ncomponent of the vectors :\nF\np\nt\nmax\nx\nx= =\nd\nd\nF\np\nt\nmay\ny\ny= =\nd\nd\nz\nz\nz a  mt\npF = =d\nd\n(4.6)\nThis means that if a force is not parallel to\nthe velocity of the body, but makes some angle\nwith it, it changes only the component of\nvelocity along the direction of force. The\nLAWS OF MOTION 55\n⊳\n⊳\ncomponent of velocity normal to the force\nremains unchanged. For example, in the\nmotion of a projectile under the vertical\ngravitational force, the horizontal component\nof velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 4.5).\n3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (4.5) is\napplicable to a single point particle. The force\nF in the law stands for the net external force\non the particle and a stands for acceleration\nof the particle. It turns out, however, that the\nlaw in the same form applies to a rigid body or,\neven more generally, to a system of particles.\nIn that case, F refers to the total external force\non the system and a refers to the acceleration\nof the system as a whole.  More precisely, a is\nthe acceleration of the centre of mass of the\nsystem about which we shall study in detail in",

    "content": "4.6  NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION\nThe second law relates the external force on a\nbody to its acceleration. What is the origin of the\nexternal force on the body ?  What agency\nprovides the external force ?  The simple answer\nin Newtonian mechanics is that the external\nforce on a body always arises due to some other\nbody.  Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives\nrise to an external force on A.  A natural question\nis: Does A in turn give rise to an external force\non B ?  In some examples, the answer seems\nclear.  If you press a coiled spring, the spring is\ncompressed by the force of your hand.  The\ncompressed spring in turn exerts a force on your\nhand and you can feel it.  But what if the bodies\nare not in contact ?  The earth pulls a stone\ndownwards due to gravity.  Does the stone exert\na force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious\nsince we hardly see the effect of the stone on the\nearth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,\nthe stone does exert an equal and opposite force\non the earth. We do not notice it since the earth\nis very massive and the effect of a small force on\nits motion is negligible.\nThus, according to Newtonian mechanics,\nforce never occurs singly in nature. Force is the\nmutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces\nalways occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces\nbetween two bodies are always equal and\nopposite.  This idea was expressed by Newton in\nthe form of the third law of motion.\nTo every action, there is always an equal and\nopposite reaction.\nNewton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and\nbeautiful that it has become a part of common\nlanguage. For the same reason perhaps,\nmisconceptions about the third law abound.  Let\nus note some important points about the third\nlaw, particularly in regard to the usage of the\nterms : action and reaction.\n1. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different\nterms for the same physical concept\ncan sometimes be confusing. A simple\nand clear way of stating the third law is as\nfollows:\nForces always occur in pairs.  Force on a\nbody A by B is equal and opposite to the\nforce on the body B by A.\n2. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmay give a wrong impression that action\ncomes before reaction i.e action is the cause\nand reaction the effect. There is no cause-\neffect relation implied in the third law.  The\nforce on A by B and the force on B by A act\nat the same instant.  By the same reasoning,\nany one of them may be called action and the\nother reaction.\n3. Action and reaction forces act on different\nbodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair\nof bodies A and B.  According to the third law,\nFAB  =  – FBA  (4.8)\n(force on A by B)  =  – (force on B by A)\nThus if we are considering the motion of any\none body (A or B), only one of the two forces is\nrelevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces\nand claim that the net force is zero.\nHowever, if you are considering the system\nof two bodies as a whole, FAB and FBA are\ninternal forces of the system (A + B). They add\nup to give a null force. Internal forces in a\nbody or a system of particles thus cancel away\nLAWS OF MOTION 57\n⊳\nin pairs.  This is an important fact that\nenables the second law to be applicable to a\nbody or a system of particles (See Chapter 6).",

(ii) the ratio of the\nmagnitudes of impulses imparted to the\nballs by the wall ?\nFig. 4.6\nAnswer  An instinctive answer to (i) might be\nthat the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to\nthe wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30°\nto the normal. This answer is wrong.  The force\non the wall is normal to the wall in both cases.\nHow to find the force on the wall? The trick is\nto consider the force (or impulse) on  the ball\ndue to  the wall using the second law, and then\nuse the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed\nof each ball before and after collision with the\nwall, and m the mass of each ball.

Using Newton’s third law of motion,\nthe force on the wall due to the ball is normal to\nthe wall along the positive x-direction.

A bullet is fired  from a gun. If the force\non the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun\nby the bullet is – F, according to the third law.\nThe two forces act for a common interval of time\nΔt.  According to the second law, F Δt is the change\nin momentum of the bullet and – F Δ t is the\nchange in momentum of the gun. Since initially,\nboth are at rest, the change in momentum equals\nthe final momentum for each. Thus if pb is the\nmomentum of the bullet after firing and pg is the\nrecoil momentum of the gun, pg = –pb  i.e. pb + pg\n= 0.  That is, the total momentum of the (bullet +\ngun) system is conserved.\nThus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with\nno external force), mutual forces between pairs\nof particles in the system can cause momentum\nchange in individual particles, but since the\nmutual forces for each pair are equal and\nopposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs\nand the total momentum remains unchanged.\nThis fact is known as the law of conservation\nof momentum :\nPHYSICS58\n⊳\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of\ninteracting particles is conserved.\nAn important example of the application of the\nlaw of conservation of momentum is the collision\nof two bodies.

    "content": "4.9  COMMON FORCES IN MECHANICS\nIn mechanics, we encounter several kinds of\nforces. The gravitational force is, of course,\npervasive.  Every object on the earth experiences\nthe force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also\ngoverns the motion of celestial bodies.  The\ngravitational force can act at a distance without\nthe need of any intervening medium.\nAll the other forces common in mechanics are\ncontact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact\nforce on an object arises due to contact with some\nother object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in\ncontact (e.g.  a book resting on a table, a system\nof rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and\nother types of supports), there are mutual\ncontact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying\nthe third law.  The component of contact force\nnormal to the surfaces in contact is called\nnormal reaction.  The component parallel to the\nsurfaces in contact is called friction.  Contact\nforces arise also when solids are in contact with\nfluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a\nfluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to\nthe weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous\nforce, air resistance, etc are also examples of\ncontact forces (Fig. 4.9).\nTwo other common forces are tension in a\nstring and the force due to spring. When a spring\nis compressed or extended by an external force,\na restoring force is generated. This force is\nusually proportional to the compression or\nelongation (for small displacements). The spring\nforce F is written as F = – k x  where x is the\ndisplacement and k is the force constant. The\nnegative sign denotes that the force is opposite\nto the displacement from the unstretched state.\nFor an inextensible string, the force constant is\nvery high. The restoring force in a string is called\ntension. It is customary to use a constant tension\nT throughout the string. This assumption is true\nfor a string of negligible mass.\nWe lear nt that ther e are four fundamental\nforces in nature.  Of these, the weak and strong\nforces appear in domains that do not concern\nus here. Only the gravitational and electrical\nforces are relevant in the context of mechanics.\nThe different contact forces of mechanics\nmentioned above fundamentally arise from\nelectrical forces.   This may seem surprising\n* We are not considering,  for simplicity, char ged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, ther e are\nelectrical and magnetic non-contact forces.\nFig. 4.9  Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.\nPHYSICS60\nsince we are talking of uncharged and non-\nmagnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic\nlevel, all bodies are made of charged constituents\n(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact\nforces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular\ncollisions and impacts, etc . can ultimately be\ntraced to the electrical forces between the charged\nconstituents of different bodies. The detailed\nmicroscopic origin of these for ces is, however,\ncomplex and not useful for handling problems in\nmechanics at the macroscopic scale.  This is why\nthey are treated as different types of forces with\ntheir characteristic properties determined\nempirically.",

    "content": "4.9.1  Friction\nLet us return to the example of a body of mass m\nat rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity\n(mg)  is cancelled by the normal reaction force\n(N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied\nhorizontally to the body.  W e know fr om\nexperience that a small  applied force may not\nbe enough to move the body.  But if the applied\nforce F were the only external force on the body,\nit must move with acceleration F/m, however\nsmall. Clearly, the body remains at rest because\nsome other force comes into play in the\nhorizontal direction and opposes the applied\nfor\nce F, resulting in zero net force on the body.\nThis force fs parallel to the surface of the body in\ncontact with the table is known as frictional\nforce, or simply friction (Fig. 4.10(a)).  The\nsubscript stands for static friction to distinguish\nit from kinetic friction fk that we consider later\n(Fig. 4.10(b)).  Note that  static friction does not\nFig. 4.10 Static and sliding friction: (a)  Impending\nmotion of the body is opposed by static\nfriction. When external force exceeds the\nmaximum limit of static friction, the body\nbegins to move.  (b) Once the body is in\nmotion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction\nwhich opposes relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is\nusually less than the maximum value of static\nexist by itself.  When there is no applied force,\nthere is no static friction. It comes into play the\nmoment there is an applied force. As the applied\nforce F increases, fs also increases, remaining\nequal and opposite to the applied force (up to a\ncertain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it\nis called static friction.  Static friction opposes\nimpending motion. The term impending motion\nmeans motion that would take place (but does\nnot actually take place) under the applied force,\nif friction were absent.\nWe know from experience that as the applied\nforce exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to\nmove.  It is found experimentally that the limiting\nvalue of static friction\n( )maxsf  is independent of\nthe area of contact and varies with the normal\nforce(N)  approximately as :\n( )maxs sf N = µ      (4.13)\nwhere µs is a constant of proportionality\ndepending only on the nature of the surfaces in\ncontact. The constant µs  is called the coefficient\nof static friction.  The law of static friction may\nthus be written as\nfs  ≤  µs  N     (4.14)\nIf the applied force F exceeds ( )maxsf  the body\nbegins to slide on the surface. It is found experi-\nmentally that when relative motion has started,\nthe frictional force decreases from the static\nmaximum value\n( )maxsf . Frictional force that\nopposes relative motion between surfaces in\ncontact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is\ndenoted by fk .  Kinetic friction, like static fric-\ntion, is found to be independent of the area of\ncontact.  Further, it is nearly independent of the\nvelocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static\nfriction:\nk k=f N µ (4.15)\nwhere µk′ the coefficient of kinetic friction,\ndepends only on the surfaces in contact. As\nmentioned above, experiments show that µk is\nless than µs. When relative motion has begun,\nthe acceleration of the body according to the\nsecond law is ( F – fk )/m.  For a body moving with\nconstant velocity, F = fk. If the applied force on\nthe body is removed, its acceleration is – fk /m\nand it eventually comes to a stop.\nThe laws of friction given above do not have\nthe status of fundamental laws like those for\ngravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They\nare empirical relations that are onlyfriction.\nLAWS OF MOTION 61\n⊳\n⊳\napproximately true.  Yet they are very useful in\npractical calculations in mechanics.\nThus, when two bodies are in contact, each\nexperiences a contact force by the other. Friction,\nby definition, is the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes\nimpending or actual relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but\nrelative motion that the frictional force opposes.\nConsider a box lying in the compartment of a train\nthat is accelerating.  If the box is stationary\nrelative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along\nwith the train. What forces cause the acceleration\nof the box?  Clearly, the only conceivable force in\nthe horizontal direction is the force of friction. If\nthere were no friction, the floor of the train would\nslip by and the box would remain at its initial\nposition due to inertia (and hit the back side of\nthe train). This impending relative motion is\nopposed by the static friction fs. Static friction\nprovides the same acceleration to the box as that\nof the train, keeping it stationary relative to the\ntrain.",

The net\neffect is that the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surface opposes motion.\nWe often r egar d friction as something\nundesirable. In many situations, like in a\nmachine with different moving parts, friction\ndoes have a negative role. It opposes relative\nmotion and thereby dissipates power in the form\nof heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing\nkinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to\nuse ball bearings between two moving parts of a\nmachine [Fig. 4.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction\nbetween ball bearings and the surfaces in\ncontact is very small, power dissipation is\nreduced. A thin cushion of air maintained\nbetween solid surfaces in relative motion is\nanother effective way of reducing friction\n(Fig. 4.13(a)).\nIn many practical situations, however, friction\nis critically needed. Kinetic friction that\ndissipates power is nevertheless important for\nquickly stopping relative motion. It is made use\nof by brakes in machines  and automobiles .\nSimilarly, static friction is important in daily\nlife.  We are able to walk because of friction.  It\nis impossible for a car to move on a very slippery\nroad. On an ordinary road, the friction between\nthe tyres and the road provides the necessary\nexternal force to accelerate the car.\nAnswer  As the string is inextensible, and the\npully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg\ntrolley both have same magnitude of\nacceleration.  Applying second law to motion of\nthe block (Fig. 4.12(b)),\n30 – T  = 3a\nApply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig.\n4.12(c)),\nT –\nfk  =  20 a.\nNow      fk = µk N,\nHere        µk = 0.04,\nN   =  20 x 10\n= 200 N.\nThus the equation for the motion of the trolley is\nT – 0.04 x 200 = 20 a  Or  T – 8 = 20a.\nThese equations give a = 22\n23\nm s –2 = 0.96 m s-2\nand T  = 27.1 N.                                                 ⊳\nRolling friction\nA body like a ring or a sphere rolling without\nslipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no\nfriction, in principle. At every instant, there is\njust one point of contact between the body and\nthe plane and this point has no motion relative\nto the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or\nstatic friction is zero and the body should\ncontinue to roll with constant velocity.  We know,\nin practice, this will not happen and some\nresistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur,\ni.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force\nis needed. For the same weight, rolling friction\nis much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of\nmagnitude) than static or sliding friction.  This\nFig. 4.13  Some ways of reducing friction.

A typical problem in\nmechanics usually does not merely involve a\nsingle body under the action of given forces.\nMore often, we will need to consider an assembly\nof different bodies exerting forces on each other.\nBesides, each body in the assembly experiences\nthe force of gravity.  When trying to solve a\nproblem of this type, it is useful to remember\nthe fact that we can choose any part of the\nassembly and apply the laws of motion to that\npart provided  we include all forces on the chosen\npart due to the  remaining parts of the assembly.\nWe may call the chosen part of the assembly as\nthe system and the remaining part of the\nassembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as\nthe envir onment. We have followed the same\nLAWS OF MOTION 65\n⊳\nmethod in solved examples. To handle a typical\nproblem in mechanics systematically, one\nshould use the following steps :\n(i) Draw a diagram showing schematically the\nvarious parts of the assembly of bodies, the\nlinks, supports, etc.\n(ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly\nas one system.\n(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this\nsystem and all the forces on the system by\nthe remaining part of the assembly.

The rest should be\ntreated as unknowns to be determined using\nlaws of motion.\n(v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for\nanother choice of the system.  In doing so,\nemploy Newton’s third law.  That is, if in the\nfree-body diagram of A, the force on A due to\nB is shown as F, then in the fr ee-body\ndiagram of B, the force on B due to A should\nbe shown as –F.\nThe following example illustrates the above\nprocedure :",

When an iron cylinder of mass 25 kg\nis placed on top of the block, the floor yields\nsteadily and the block and the cylinder\ntogether go down with an acceleration of\n0.1 m s–2.  What is the action of the block\non the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor\nyields ? Take g =  10 m s –2. Identify the\naction-reaction pairs in the problem.\nAnswer\n(a) The block is at rest on the floor. Its free-body\ndiagram shows two forces on the block, the\nforce of gravitational attraction by the earth\nequal to 2 × 10 = 20 N; and the normal force\nR of the floor on the block. By the First Law,\nthe net force on the block must be zero i.e.,\nR = 20 N.  Using third law the action of the\nblock (i.e. the force exerted on the floor by\nthe block) is equal to 20 N and directed\nvertically downwards.\n(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates\ndownwards with 0.1  m s-2. The free-body\ndiagram of the system shows two forces on\nthe system : the force of gravity due to the\nearth (270 N); and the normal force R′ by the\nfloor.  Note, the fr ee-body diagram of the\nsystem does not show the internal forces\nbetween the block and the cylinder.  Applying\nthe second law to the system,\n270 – R′   =  27 × 0.1N\nie. R′   =  267.3 N\nFig. 4.15\nBy the third law, the  action  of the system on\nthe floor is equal to 267.3 N vertically downward.\nAction-reaction pairs\nFor (a): (i) the force of gravity (20 N) on the block\nby the earth (say, action); the force of\ngravity on the earth by the block\n(reaction) equal to 20 N directed\nupwards (not shown in the figure).\n(ii) the force on the floor by the block\n(action); the force on the block by the\nfloor (reaction).\nFor (b): (i) the force of gravity (270 N) on the\nsystem by the earth (say, action); the\nforce of gravity on the earth by the\nsystem (reaction), equal to 270 N,\nPHYSICS66\ndirected upwards (not shown in the\nfigure).\n(ii) the force on the floor by the system\n(action); the force on the system by the\nfloor (reaction).  In addition, for (b), the\nforce on the block by the cylinder and\nthe force on the cylinder by the block\nalso constitute an action-reaction pair.\nThe important thing to remember is that an\naction-reaction pair consists of mutual forces\nwhich are always equal and opposite between\ntwo bodies.  Two forces on the same body which\nhappen to be equal and opposite can never\nconstitute an action-reaction pair. The force of\ngravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal\nforce on the mass by the floor are not action-\nreaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal\nand opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest.\nThey are not so for case (b), as seen already.\nThe weight of the system is 270 N, while the\nnormal force R′ is 267.3 N. ⊳\nThe practice of drawing free-body diagrams is\nof great help in solving problems in mechanics.\nIt allows you to clearly define your system and\nconsider all forces on the system due to objects\nthat are not part of the system itself.

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong.  A\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\n2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\nthus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law\nis “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\n3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\np  =  m v\n4. Newton’s second law of motion :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.\nThus\nd\nd\nk k m\nt\n= = pF a\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\nd\nd\nm\nt\n= = pF a\nThe SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law ( F = 0 implies a = 0)\n(b) It is a vector equation\n(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\na whole.\n(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\nhistory of motion.\n4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\nthe action of the impulsive force.\n6. Newton’s third law of motion:\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\nLAWS OF MOTION 67\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\n7. Law of Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\n8. Friction\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction\nfs opposes impending relative\nmotion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\n( )max\nf f Rs s s≤ = µ\nkf R k= µ\nµs (co-efficient of static friction) and µk (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.  It is found\nexperimentally that µk is less than µs .",

    "content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\nmay be along v, opposite to v, normal to\nv or may make some other angle with\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\n2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\n3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\nthe body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\n4. In the second law of motion F = m  a, F stands for the net force due to all\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\nPHYSICS68\n5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\nbody in cir cular motion. We should always look for some material for ce like\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\nin any circular motion.\n6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit\nµs N (fs ≤ µs N).  Do not put\nfs= µs N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\ninto play.\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\nlaw.\n8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\nact on different bodies.\n9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,\n‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.\n10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\n11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the\nsubjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’.  On a merry-go-around, all parts of\nour body are subject to an  inward force,  but we have a feeling of being pushed\noutward – the direction of impending motion.",

    "content": "5.1  INTRODUCTION\nThe terms ‘work’, ‘energy’ and ‘power’ are frequently used\nin everyday language.  A farmer ploughing the field, a\nconstruction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for\na competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful\nlandscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however ,\nthe word ‘W ork’ cover s a definite  and precise meaning.\nSomebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a\nday is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a\nlong distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is\nthus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’\nis related to work in this sense, but as said above the term\n‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’\nis used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In\nkarate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are\ndelivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to\nthe meaning of the wor d ‘power’ used in physics.  We shall\nfind that there is at best a loose correlation betwee n the\nphysical definitions and the physiological pictures these\nterms generate in our minds.  The aim of this chapter is to\ndevelop an understanding of these three physical quantities.\nBefore we proceed to this task, we need to develop a\nmathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two\nvectors.",

Multiplying both\nsides by m/2, we have\n2 21 1\n2 2mv mu mas Fs− = = (5.2a)\nwhere the last step follows from Newton’s Second\nLaw. W e can generalise Eq. (5.2) to thr ee\ndimensions by employing vectors\nv2 − u2 = 2 a.d\nHere a and d are acceleration and displacement\nvectors of the object respectively.\nOnce again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain\n2 21 1\n2 2mv mu m − = = a.d F.d (5.2b)\nThe above equation provides a motivation for\nthe definitions of work and kinetic energy. The\nleft side of the equation is the difference in the\nquantity ‘half the mass times the square of the\nspeed’ from its initial value to its final value. We\ncall each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,\ndenoted by K. The right side is a product of the\ndisplacement and the component of the force\nalong the displacement.  This quantity is called\n‘work’ and is denoted by W.  Eq. (5.2b) is then\nKf\n−  Ki = W (5.3)\nwhere Ki  and Kf  are respectively the initial and\nfinal kinetic energies of the object.

(5.5)\nKinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic\nenergy of an object is a measure of the work an\nThe work done by the force is defined to be\nthe product of component of the force in the\ndirection of the displacement and the\nmagnitude of this displacement.  Thus\nW = (F cos\nθ )d = F.d (5.4)\nWe see that if there is no displacement, there\nis no work done even if the force is large.  Thus,\nwhen you push hard against a rigid brick wall,\nthe force you exert on the wall does no work.  Yet\nyour muscles are alternatively contracting and\nrelaxing and internal energy is being used up\nand you do get tired.  Thus, the meaning of work\nin physics is different from its usage in everyday\nlanguage.\nNo work is done if :\n(i) the displacement is zero as seen in the\nexample above. A weightlifter holding a 150\nkg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s\ndoes no work on the load during this time.\n(ii) the force is zero.  A block moving on a smooth\nhorizontal table is not acted upon by a\nhorizontal force (since there is no friction), but\nmay undergo a large displacement.\n(iii) the force and displacement are mutually\nperpendicular. This is so since, for\nθ = π/2 rad\n(= 90o), cos (π/2) = 0.  For the block moving on\na smooth horizontal table, the gravitational\nforce mg  does no work since it acts at right\nangles to the displacement. If we assume that\nthe moon’s orbits around the earth is\nperfectly circular then the earth’s\ngravitational force does no work.  The moon’s\ninstantaneous displacement is tangential\nwhile the earth’s force is radially inwards and\nθ  = π/2.\nWork can be both positive and negative.  If θ  is\nbetween 0o and 90o, cos θ  in Eq. (5.4) is positive.\nIf  θ  is  between 90o and 180o,   cos θ  is negative.\nIn many examples the frictional force opposes\ndisplacement and\nθ  = 180o. Then the work done\nby friction is negative (cos 180o = –1).\nFrom Eq. (5.4) it is clear that  work and energy\nhave the same dimensions,  [ML2T–2]. The SI unit\nof these is joule (J), named after the famous British\nphysicist James Prescott Joule  (1811-1869). Since\nwork and energy are so widely used as physical\nconcepts, alternative units abound and some of\nthese are listed in Table 5.1.\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 75\n⊳\nobject can do by the virtue of its motion.

    "content": "5.7  THE CONCEPT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY\nThe word potential suggests possibility or\ncapacity for action. The term potential energy\nbrings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched\nbow-string possesses potential energy. When it\nis released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.\nThe earth’s crust is not uniform, but has\ndiscontinuities and dislocations that are called\nfault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust\nare like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a\nlarge amount of potential energy. An earthquake\nresults when these fault lines readjust. Thus,\npotential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue\nof the position or configuration of a body. The\nbody left to itself releases this stored energy in\nthe form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion\nof potential energy more concrete.\nThe gravitational force on a ball of mass m is\nmg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth\nsurface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h  of\nthe ball above the earth’s surface is very small\ncompared to the earth’s radius RE (h <<RE) so that\nwe can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s\nsurface*. In what follows we have taken the\nupward direction to be positive. Let us raise the\nball up to a height h. The work done by the external\nagency against the gravitational force is mgh. This\nwork gets stored as potential energy.\nGravitational potential energy of an object, as a\nfunction of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it\nis the negative of work done by the gravitational\nforce in raising the object to that height.\nV (h) = mgh\nIf h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that\nthe gravitational force F equals the negative of\nthe derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,\nd\ndF V(h) m gh= − = −\nThe negative sign indicates that the\ngravitational force is downward. When released,\nthe ball comes down with an increasing speed.\nJust before it hits the ground, its speed is given\nby the kinematic relation,\nv2 = 2gh\nThis equation can be written as\n2\n1\nm v2 = m g h\nwhich shows that the gravitational potential\nenergy of the object at height h, when the object\nis released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of\nthe object on reaching the ground.\nPhysically, the notion of potential energy is\napplicable only to the class of forces where work\ndone against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.\nWhen external constraints are removed, it\nmanifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,\n(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential\n* The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 7 on Gravitation.\nPHYSICS78\nenergy V(x) is defined if the force F(x) can be\nwritten as\n( ) d\nd\nVF x x= −\nThis implies that\nF(x) x V V V\nx\nx\ni f\nV\nV\ni\nf\ni\nf\nd d∫ ∫ = − = −\nThe work done by a conservative force such as\ngravity depends on the initial and final positions\nonly. In the previous chapter we have worked\non examples dealing with inclined planes. If an\nobject of mass m is released from rest, from the\ntop of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of\nheight h, its speed at the bottom\nis\ngh2 irrespective of the angle of inclination.\nThus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it\nacquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done\nor the kinetic energy did depend on other factors\nsuch as the velocity or the particular path taken\nby the object, the force would be called non-\nconservative.\nThe  dimensions  of  potential  energy are\n[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as\nkinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change\nin potential energy, for a conservative force,\n∆V  is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthe force\n∆V =\n− F(x) ∆x (5.9)\nIn the example of the falling ball considered in\nthis section we saw how potential energy was\nconverted to kinetic energy. This hints at an\nimportant principle of conservation in mechanics,\nwhich we now proceed to examine.",

    "content": "5.8 THE CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL\nENERGY\nFor simplicity we demonstrate this important\nprinciple for one-dimensional motion. Suppose\nthat a body undergoes displacement ∆x under\nthe action of a conservative force F. Then from\nthe WE theorem we have,\n∆K =  F(x) ∆x\nIf the force is conservative, the potential energy\nfunction V(x) can be defined such that\n− ∆V  =  F(x) ∆x\nThe above equations imply that\n∆K + ∆V = 0\n∆(K + V ) = 0 (5.10)\nwhich means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic\nand potential energies of the body is a constant.\nOver the whole path,\nxi to xf, this means that\nKi + V(xi ) = Kf  + V(xf) (5.11)\nThe quantity K +V(x), is called the total\nmechanical energy of the system.  Individually\nthe kinetic energy K  and the potential energy\nV(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum\nis a constant. The aptness of the term\n‘conservative force’ is now clear.\nLet us consider some of  the definitions of a\nconservative force.\nl A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived\nfrom a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation\ngiven by Eq. (5.9). The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\nl The work done by the conservative for ce\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen from the relation,\nW = Kf – Ki = V (xi) – V(xf)\nwhich depends on the end points.\nl A third definition states that the work done\nby this force in a closed path is zero.

    "content": "5.9  THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING\nThe spring force is an example of a variable force\nwhich is conservative. Fig. 5.7 shows a block\nattached to a spring and resting on a smooth\nhorizontal surface.  The other end of the spring\nis attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light\nand may be tr eated as massless.  In an ideal\nspring, the spring for ce Fs  is pr oportional to\nx where x  is the displacement of the block from\nthe equilibrium position. The displacement could\nbe either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative\n[Fig. 5.7(c)].  This force law for the spring is called\nHooke’s law and is mathematically stated as\nFs =  − kx\nThe constant k is called the spring constant.  Its\nunit is N m-1.  The spring is said to be stiff if k\nis\nlarge and soft if k is small.\nSuppose that we pull the block outwards as in\nFig. 5.7(b). If the extension is xm, the work done by\nthe spring force is\nW F  xs s\n0\nxm\n= ∫ d     = − ∫ kx x\n0\nxm\nd\n2\n2\nmx  k− =     (5.15)\nThis expression may also be obtained by\nconsidering the area of the triangle as in\nFig. 5.7(d).  Note that the work don e by the\nexternal pulling force F is positive since it\novercomes the spring force.\n2\n2\nmx  kW + = (5.16)\nFig. 5.7 Illustration of the spring force with a block\nattached to the free end of the spring.\n(a) The spring force F s is zero when the\ndisplacement x  from the equilibrium position\nis zero. (b) For the str etched spring x > 0\nand F s  < 0 (c) For the compressed spring\nx < 0 and  Fs > 0.(d) The plot of Fs  versus x.\nThe area of the shaded triangle represents\nthe work done by the spring force. Due to the\nopposing signs of Fs and x, this work done is\nnegative,\nW kx /s m\n2= − 2.\nThe same is true when the spring is\ncompressed with a displacement xc (< 0).  The\nspring force does work 2 /  2\ncs kx W− =  while the\nWORK, ENERGY AND POWER 81\nFig. 5.8 Parabolic plots of the potential energy V and\nkinetic energy K of a block attached to a\nspring obeying Hooke’s law. The two plots\nare complementary, one decreasing as the\nother incr eases. The total mechanical\nenergy E = K + V remains constant.\n⊳\nexternal force F does work + kxc\n2 / 2. If the block\nis moved from an initial displacement xi  to a\nfinal displacement xf , the work done by the\nspring force Ws is\nW k x x k x k x\ns\nx\nx\ni f\ni\nf\n= − = −∫ d\n2 2\n2 2            (5.17)\nThus the work done by the spring force depends\nonly on the end points.  Specifically, if the block\nis pulled from xi  and allowed to return to xi ;\nW k x x       k x k x  s\ni i\nx\nx\ni\ni\n= − = −∫ d\n2 2\n2 2\n= 0 (5.18)\nThe work done by the spring force in a cyclic\nprocess is zero.  We have explicitly demonstrated\nthat the spring force (i) is position dependent\nonly as first stated by Hooke, ( Fs = − kx); (ii)\ndoes work which only depends on the initial and\nfinal positions, e.g. Eq. (5.17).  Thus, the spring\nfor\nce is a conservative force.\nWe define the potential energy V(x) of the spring\nto be zero when block and spring system is in the\nequilibrium position.  For an extension (or\ncompression) x  the above analysis suggests that\nV(x) kx2\n= 2\n(5.19)\nYou may easily verify that − dV/dx = − k x, the\nspring force.  If the block of mass m in Fig. 5.7 is\nextended to xm and released from rest, then its\ntotal mechanical energy at any arbitrary point x,\nwhere x lies between – xm  and + xm, will be given by\n222\nm v  m x  k x  k2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 + =\nwhere we have invoked the conservation of\nmechanical energy.  This suggests that the speed\nand the kinetic energy will be maximum at the\nequilibrium position, x = 0, i.e.,\n2\nm\n2\nm x  k   v  m2\n1\n2\n1 =\nwhere vm is the maximum speed.\nor mm x  m\nkv =\nNote that k/m has the dimensions of [T -2] and\nour equation is dimensionally correct. The\nkinetic energy gets converted to potential energy\nand vice versa, however, the total mechanical\nenergy remains constant. This is graphically\ndepicted in Fig. 5.8.",

In the example considered\nabove, we can calculate the compression, but\nnot the time over which the compression\noccurs.  A solution of Newton’s Second Law\nfor this system is required for temporal\ninformation.\n(ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for\nexample, is a non-conservative force. The\nprinciple of conservation of energy will have\nto be modified in this case. This is illustrated\nin Example 5.9.\n(iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.\nIt is set according to convenience.  For the\nspring force we took V(x) = 0, at x = 0, i.e. the\nunstretched spring had zero potential\nenergy.  For the constant gravitational force\nmg, we took V =\n0  on the earth’s surface.  In\na later chapter we shall see that for the force\ndue to the universal law of gravitation, the\nzero is best defined at an infinite distance\nfrom the gravitational source. However, once\nthe zero of the potential energy is fixed in a\ngiven discussion, it must be consistently\nadhered to throughout the discussion. You\ncannot change horses in midstream !",

When two objects\ncollide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over\nthe collision time ∆t cause a change in their\nrespective momenta :\n∆p1\n= F12  ∆t\n∆p2 = F21  ∆t\nwhere F12 is  the force exerted on the first particle\nby the second particle. F21 is likewise the force\nexerted on the second particle by the first particle.\nNow from Newton’s third law, F12 = − F21.  This\nimplies\n∆p1 +\n∆p2 =  0\nThe above conclusion is true even though the\nforces vary in a complex fashion during the\ncollision time ∆t. Since the third law is true at\nevery instant, the total impulse on the first object\nis equal and opposite to that on the second.\nOn the other hand, the total kinetic energy of\nthe system is not necessarily conserved. The\nimpact and deformation during collision may\ngenerate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic\nenergy is transformed into other forms of energy.\nA useful way to visualise the deformation during\ncollision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If\nthe ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains\nits original shape without loss in energy , then\nthe initial kinetic energy is equal to the final\nkinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the\ncollision time ∆t is not constant. Such a collision\nis called an elastic collision. On the other hand\nthe deformation may not be relieved and the two\nbodies could move together after the collision. A\ncollision in which the two particles move together\nafter the collision is called a completely inelastic\ncollision . The intermediate case where the\ndeformation is partly relieved and some of the\ninitial kinetic energy is lost is more common and\nis appropriately called an inelastic collision.",

A  force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path  independent and\ndepends only on the end points { xi, xj}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an\narbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.\n3.

The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical\nenergy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.\n5. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x  about the earth’s\nsurface is\nV(x) = m g x\nwhere the variation of g with height is ignored.\n5.

    "content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. W e should refer (or imply\nclearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a\ngiven  body over a certain displacement.\n2. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and\nkinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction\nor viscous force on a moving body is negative.\n3. For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from\nNewton’s Third Law,\nF12  +  F21  =  0\nBut the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.\nW12  + W21\n≠  0\nHowever, it may sometimes be true.\n4. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of\nthe force is not known. This is clear from Example 5.2 where the WE theorem is\nused in such a situation.\n5. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem\nmay be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation\nof mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for\nconservative forces.\n5. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-\ninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the\nnet force acting on the body under consideration.\n7. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always\nundetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential\nenergy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mgh,\nthe zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring\npotential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position\nof the oscillating mass.\n8. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential\nenergy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no\npotential energy can be associated with friction.\n9. During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of\nthe collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is  elastic)\napplies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.\nIn fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may  be momentarily at rest\nwith respect to each other.\nPHYSICS88",

    "content": "6.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the earlier chapters we primarily consider ed the motion\nof a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  W e applied the r esults of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\nAny r eal body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept her e.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\nA large class of pr oblems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident from\nthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,\nsince real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in\nmany situations the deformations are negligible.  In a number\nof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel\nbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore\nthat they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat\nthem as rigid.",

Its motion down the plane is such that all\nthe particles of the body ar e moving together ,\ni.e. they have the same velocity at any instant\nof time. The rigid body here is in pure\ntranslational motion (Fig. 6.1).\nIn pure translational motion at any\ninstant of time, all particles of the body have\nthe same velocity.\nConsider now the r olling motion of a solid\nmetallic or wooden cylinder down the same\ninclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this\nproblem, namely the cylinder , shifts fr om the\ntop to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,\nseems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.\n6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with\nthe same velocity at any instant. The body,\ntherefore, is not in pure translational motion.\nIts motion is translational plus ‘something else.’\nIn order to understand what this ‘something\nelse’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained\nthat it cannot have translational motion.  The\nmost common way to constrain a rigid body so\nthat it does not have translational motion is to\nfix it along a straight line. The only possible\nmotion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line\nor fixed axis about which the body is rotating is\nits axis of rotation. If you look around, you will\ncome across many examples of rotation about\nan axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant\nwheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig\n6.3(a) and (b)).\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 6.3 Rotation about a fixed axis\n(a) A ceiling fan\n(b) A potter’s wheel.\nLet us try to understand what rotation is,\nwhat characterises rotation.  You may notice that\nin rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis,\nFig 6.1 Translational (sliding) motion of a block down\nan inclined plane.\n(Any point like P 1 or P 2 of the block moves\nwith the same velocity at any instant of time.)\nFig. 6.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder . It is not pure\ntranslational motion. Points P1, P2, P3 and P4\nhave different velocities (shown by arrows)\nat any instant of time. In fact, the velocity of\nthe point of contact P3 is zero at any instant,\nif the cylinder rolls without slipping.\n94 PHYSICS\nevery particle of the body moves in a circle,\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis.  Fig. 6.4 shows\nthe rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis (the z-axis of the frame of reference).  Let P1\nbe a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen\nand at a distance r1 from fixed axis.  The particle\nP1 describes a circle of radius  r1 with its centre\nC1 on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows\nanother particle P 2 of the rigid body, P 2 is at a\ndistance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P 2\nmoves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2\non the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis.  Note that the circles\ndescribed by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes;\nboth these planes, however, are perpendicular\nto the fixed axis.  For any particle on the axis\nlike P 3, r = 0. Any such particle remains\nstationary while the body rotates.  This is\nexpected since the axis of rotation is fixed.\nFig. 6.5 (a) A spinning top\n(The point of contact of the top with the\nground, its tip O, is fixed.)\nFig. 6.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating\nblades. The pivot of the fan, point O, is\nfixed. The blades of the fan are under\nrotational motion, whereas, the axis of\nrotation of  the fan blades is oscillating.\nFig. 6.4 A rigid body rotation about the z-axis (Each\npoint of the body such as P 1 or\nP2 describes a circle with its centre (C 1\nor C2) on the axis of rotation.  The radius of\nthe circle (r1or r 2) is the perpendicular\ndistance of the point (P1 or P 2) from the\naxis. A point on the axis like P 3 remains\nstationary).\nAxis of oscillation\nAxis of\nrotation\nfrom blades\nIn some examples of rotation, however, the\naxis may not be fixed.  A prominent example of\nthis kind of rotation is a top spinning in place\n[Fig. 6.5(a)].  (We assume that the top does not\nslip from place to place and so does not have\ntranslational motion.)  We know from experience\nthat the axis of such a spinning top moves\naround the vertical through its point of contact\nwith the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown\nin Fig. 6.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of the\ntop around the vertical is termed precession.)\nNote, the point of contact of the top with\nground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top\nat any instant passes thr ough the point of\ncontact. Another simple example of this kind of\nrotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal\nfan [Fig.6.5(b)]. You may have observed that the\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 95\naxis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating\n(sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about\nthe vertical through the point at which the axis\nis pivoted (point O in Fig. 6.5(b)).\nWhile the fan r otates and its axis moves\nsidewise, this point is fixed.  Thus, in mor e\ngeneral cases of r otation, such as the r otation\nof a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not\none line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case\nthe axis is not fixed, though it always passes\nthrough the fixed point. In our study, however,\nwe mostly deal with the simpler and special case\nof rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.\nThus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis\nonly unless stated otherwise.\nThe r olling motion of a cylinder down an\ninclined plane is a combination of rotation about\na fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the\n‘something else’ in the case of r olling motion\nwhich we referred to earlier is rotational motion.\nYou will find Fig. 6.6(a) and (b) instructive from\nthis point of view. Both these figures show\nmotion of the same body along identical\ntranslational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 6.6(a),\nthe motion is a pur e translation; in the other\ncase [Fig. 6.6(b)] it is a combination of translation\nand rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two\ntypes of motion shown, using a rigid object like\na heavy book.)\nWe now r ecapitulate the most important\nobservations of the present section: The motion\nof a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in\nsome way is either a pure translation or a\ncombination of translation and rotation. The\nmotion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed\nin some way is rotation.  The rotation may be\nabout an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or\nmoving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.6.5(b)]).\nWe shall, in the pr esent chapter , consider\nrotational motion about a fixed axis only.",

For simplicity we shall start with\na two particle system.

As seen from Fig. 6.6(a), at any\ninstant the velocities of any particles like O and P of\nthe body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in\nthis case the orientation of OP, i.e. the angle OP makes\nwith a fixed dir ection, say the horizontal, r emains\nthe same, i.e.\nα1 = α2 = α3. Fig. 6.6 (b) illustrates a case\nof combination of translation and rotation. In this case,\nat any instants the velocities of O and P dif fer. Also,\nα1, α2 and α3 may all be different.\n96 PHYSICS\nparticles. The centre of mass of the system is\nthat   point C which is at a distance X from O,\nwhere X is given by\n1 1 2 2\n1 2\nm x m xX m m\n+= + (6.1)\nIn Eq. (6.1), X can be regarded as the mass-\nweighted mean of  x1 and x2. If the two particles\nhave the same mass m1 = m2 = m, then\n1 2 1 2\n2 2\nmx mx x xX m\n+ += =\nThus, for two particles of equal mass the\ncentre of mass lies exactly midway between\nthem.\nIf we have n particles of masses m1, m2,\n...mn respectively, along a straight line taken as\nthe\nx- axis, then by definition the position of the\ncentre of the mass of the system of particles is\ngiven by.\nX m x m x m x\nm m m\nm x\nm\nm x\nm\nn n\nn\ni i\ni\nn\ni\ni\nn\ni i\ni\n= = ==\n=\n∑\n∑\n∑\n∑\n1 1 2 2\n1 2\n1\n1\n+ + . .. +\n+ +..\n. +   (6.2)\nwhere  x1, x2,...xn are the distances of the\nparticles from the origin; X is also measured from\nthe same origin. The symbol ∑ (the Greek letter\nsigma) denotes summation, in this case over n\nparticles. The sum\nim M=∑\nis the total mass of the system.\nSuppose that we have thr ee particles, not\nlying in a straight line. We may define x– and y–\naxes in the plane in which the particles lie and\nrepresent the positions of the three particles by\ncoordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.\nLet the masses of the three particles be m1, m2\nand m3 respectively. The centr e of mass C of\nthe system of the three particles is defined and\nlocated by the coordinates (X, Y) given by\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n1 2 3\nm x m x m xX m m m\n+ += + + (6.3a)\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n1 2 3\nm y m y m yY m m m\n+ += + + (6.3b)\nFor the particles of equal mass m = m1 = m2\n= m3,\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n3 3\nm x x x x x xX m\n+ + + += =\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n3 3\nm y y y y y yY m\n+ + + += =\nThus, for three particles of equal mass, the\ncentre of mass coincides with the centroid of the\ntriangle formed by the particles.\nResults of Eqs. (6.3a) and (6.3b) are\ngeneralised easily to a system of n particles, not\nnecessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in\nspace. The centre of mass of such a system is\nat (X, Y, Z ), where\ni im xX M= ∑ (6.4a)\ni im yY M= ∑ (6.4b)\nand\ni im zZ M= ∑ (6.4c)\nHere M = im∑ is the total mass of the\nsystem. The index i runs from 1 to n; mi is the\nmass of the ith particle and the position of the\nith particle is given by (xi, yi, zi).\nEqs. (6.4a), (6.4b) and (6.4c) can be\ncombined into one equation using the notation\nof position vectors. Let  ir  be the position vector\nof the ith particle and R be the position vector of\nthe centre of mass:\n\u0001\ni i i ix y z= + +r i j kɵ ɵ\nand \u0001X Y Z= + +R i j kɵ ɵ\nThen\ni im\nM= ∑ rR\n(6.4d)\nThe sum on the right hand side is a vector\nsum.\nNote the economy of expressions we achieve\nby use of vectors. If the origin of the frame of\nreference (the coordinate system) is chosen to\nbe the centr e of mass then  0i im =∑ r for the\ngiven system of particles.\nA rigid body, such as a metre stick or a\nflywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;\nEqs. (6.4a), (6.4b), (6.4c) and (6.4d) are therefore,\napplicable to a rigid body. The number of\nparticles (atoms or molecules) in such a body is\nso large that it is impossible to carry out the\nsummations over individual particles in these\nequations. Since the spacing of the particles is\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 97\nsmall, we can treat the body as a continuous\ndistribution of mass. We subdivide the body into\nn small elements of mass;  ∆m1, ∆m2... ∆mn; the\nith element  ∆mi is taken to be located about the\npoint  (xi, yi, zi). The coordinates of the centre of\nmass are then approximately given by\n( ) ( ) ( ) , ,\ni i i i i i\ni i i\nm x m y m zX Y Zm m m\n∆ ∆ ∆= = =∆ ∆ ∆\n∑ ∑ ∑\n∑ ∑ ∑\nAs we make n bigger and bigger and each\n∆mi smaller and smaller , these expr essions\nbecome exact. In that case, we denote the sums\nover i by integrals. Thus,\n∆m m Mi → =∫∑ d ,\n( ) ,∆m x x mi i → ∫∑ d\n( ) ,∆m y y mi i → ∫∑ d\nand (∆m z z mi i) → ∫∑ d\nHere M is the total mass of the body. The\ncoordinates of the centre of mass now are\nX M x m Y M y m Z M z m= = = ∫ ∫ ∫\n1 1 1d d d, and     (6.5a)\nThe vector expression equivalent to these\nthree scalar expressions is\nR r= ∫\n1\nM md (6.5b)\nIf we choose, the centre of mass as the origin\nof our coordinate system,\n=R 0\ni.e., r 0dm =∫\nor x m y m z md d d= = =∫ ∫ ∫ 0 (6.6)\nOften we have to calculate the centre of mass of\nhomogeneous bodies of regular shapes like rings,\ndiscs, spheres, rods etc. (By a homogeneous body\nwe mean a body with uniformly distributed\nmass.) By using symmetry consideration, we can\neasily show that the centres of mass of these\nbodies lie at their geometric centres.\nLet us consider a thin rod, whose width and\nbreath (in case the cross section of the rod is\nrectangular) or radius (in case the cross section\nof the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than\nits length. T aking the origin to be at the\ngeometric centr e of the r od and x-axis to be\nalong the length of the rod, we can say that on\naccount of r eflection symmetry, for every\nelement dm of the rod at x, there is an element\nof the same mass dm located at –x (Fig. 6.8).\nThe net contribution of every such pair to\nthe integral and hence the integral\nitself\nis zero.  From Eq. (6.6), the point for which the\nintegral  itself is zer o, is the centr e of mass.\nThus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin\nrod coincides with its geometric centre. This can\nbe understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.\nThe same symmetry argument will apply to\nhomogeneous rings, discs, spher es, or even\nthick r ods of cir cular or r ectangular cr oss\nsection. For all such bodies you will realise that\nfor every element dm at a point (x, y, z) one can\nalways take an element of the same mass at\nthe point (–x, –y, –z). (In other words, the origin\nis a point of r eflection symmetry for these\nbodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (6.5 a)\nall are zero. This means that for all the above\nbodies, their centre of mass coincides with their\ngeometric centre.",

    "content": "6.3  MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS\nEquipped with the definition of the centr e of\nmass, we ar e now in a position to discuss its\nphysical importance for a system of n particles.\nWe may rewrite Eq.(6.4d) as\n1 1 2 2 ...i i n nM m m m m= = + + +∑R r r r r (6.7)\nDifferentiating the two sides of the equation\nwith respect to time we get\n1 2\n1 2\ndd dd ...d d d\nn\nnM m m mt t t dt= + + + rr rR\nor\n1 1 2 2 ... n nM m m m= + + +V v v v (6.8)\nwhere  ( )1 1 d /d t=v r  is the velocity of the first\nparticle ( )2 2 d dt=v r is the velocity of the\nsecond particle etc. and d /d t=V R  is the\nvelocity of the centr e of mass. Note that we\nassumed the masses m1, m2, ... etc. do not\nchange in time. We have therefore, treated them\nas constants in dif ferentiating the equations\nwith respect to time.\nDifferentiating Eq.(6.8) with respect to time,\nwe obtain\n1 2\n1 2\ndd dd ...d d d d\nn\nnM m m mt t t t= + + + vv vV\nor\n1 1 2 2 ... n nM m m m= + + +A a a a (6.9)\nwhere ( )1 1 d /d t=a v  is the acceleration of the\nfirst particle,  ( )2 2 d /d t=a v  is the acceleration\nof the second particle etc. and  ( )d /d t=A V  is\nthe acceleration of the centr e of mass of the\nsystem of particles.\nNow, from Newton’s second law, the for ce\nacting on the first particle is given by 1 1 1m=F a .\nThe force acting on the second particle is given\nby 2 2 2m=F a and so on. Eq. (6.9) may be written\nas\n1 2 ... nM = + + +A F F F (6.10)\nThus, the total mass of a system of particles\ntimes the acceleration of its centre of mass is\nthe vector sum of all the forces acting on the\nsystem of particles.\nNote when we talk of the force\n1F on the first\nparticle, it is not a single for ce, but the vector\nsum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise\nfor the second particle etc. Among these forces\non each particle ther e will be external forces\nexerted by bodies outside the system and also\ninternal forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother. We know from Newton’s third law that\nthese internal forces occur in equal and opposite\npairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (6.10), their\ncontribution is zero. Only the external forces\ncontribute to the equation. We can then rewrite\nEq. (6.10) as\nextM =A F (6.11)\nwhere extF  represents the sum of all external\nforces acting on the particles of the system.\nEq. (6.11) states that the centre of mass of\na system of particles moves as if all the mass\nof the system was concentrated at the centre\nof mass and all the external forces were\napplied at that point.\nNotice, to determine the motion of the centre\nof mass no knowledge of inter nal forces of the\nsystem of particles is required; for this purpose\nwe need to know only the external forces.\nTo obtain Eq. (6.11) we did not need to specify\nthe nature of the system of particles. The system\nmay be a collection of particles in which there\nmay be all kinds of internal motions, or it may\nbe a rigid body which has either pure\ntranslational motion or a combination of\ntranslational and rotational motion. Whatever\nis the system and the motion of its individual\nparticles, the centre of mass moves according\nto Eq. (6.11).\nInstead of treating extended bodies as single\nparticles as we have done in earlier chapters,\nwe can now treat them as systems of particles.\nWe can obtain the translational component of\ntheir motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass\nof the system, by taking the mass of the whole\nsystem to be concentrated at the centre of mass\nand all the external forces on the system to be\nacting at the centre of mass.\nThis is the procedure that we followed earlier\nin analysing for ces on bodies and solving\n100 PHYSICS\nproblems without explicitly outlining and\njustifying the procedure. We now realise that in\nearlier studies we assumed, without saying so,\nthat rotational motion and/or inter nal motion\nof the particles were either absent or negligible.\nWe no longer need to do this. We have not only\nfound the justification of the pr ocedur e we\nfollowed earlier; but we also have found how to\ndescribe and separate the translational motion\nof (1) a rigid body which may be r otating as\nwell,  or (2) a system of particles with all kinds\nof internal motion.\nFig. 6.12 The centre of mass of the fragments\nof the pr ojectile continues along the\nsame parabolic path which it would\nhave followed if ther e wer e no\nexplosion.\nFigure 6.12 is a good illustration of Eq. (6.11).\nA projectile, following the usual parabolic\ntrajectory, explodes into fragments midway in\nair. The for ces leading to the explosion ar e\ninternal forces. They contribute nothing to the\nmotion of the centre of mass. The total external\nforce, namely, the force of gravity acting on the\nbody, is the same before and after the explosion.\nThe centre of mass under the influence of the\nexternal force continues, ther efore, along the\nsame parabolic trajectory as it would have\nfollowed if there were no explosion.",

Yet, if the total external\nforce acting on the system is zero, the centre of\nmass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves\nuniformly in a straight line like a fr ee particle.\nThe vector Eq.

The two product particles fly back\nto back.\nAs an example, let us consider the\nradioactive decay of a moving unstable particle,\nlike the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus\ndisintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an\nalpha particle. The for ces leading to the decay\nare inter nal to the system and the exter nal\nforces on the system are negligible.

The two particles\nproduced in the decay, the radon nucleus and\nthe alpha particle, move in dif ferent directions\nin such a way that their centr e of mass moves\nalong the same path along which the original\ndecaying radium nucleus was moving\n[Fig. 6.13(a)].\nIf we observe the decay from the frame of\nreference in which the centre of mass is at rest,\nthe motion of the particles involved in the decay\nlooks particularly simple; the product particles\nmove back to back with their centre of mass\nremaining at rest as shown in Fig.6.13 (b).\nIn many problems on the system of\nparticles , as in the above radioactive decay\nproblem, it is convenient to work in the centr e\nof mass frame rather than in the laboratory\nframe of r eference.\nIn astr onomy, binary (double) stars is a\ncommon occurr ence. If ther e are no exter nal\nforces, the centre of mass of a double star\nmoves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.6.14\n(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal\nmass ar e also shown in the figur e; they look\ncomplicated. If we go to the centr e of mass\nframe, then we find that ther e the two stars\nare moving in a cir cle, about the centr e of\nmass, which is at r est. Note that the position\nof the stars have to be diametrically opposite\nto each other [Fig. 6.14(b) ]. Thus in our frame\nof reference, the trajectories of the stars ar e a\ncombination of (i) uniform motion in a straight\nline of the centr e of mass and (ii) cir cular\norbits of the stars about the centr e of mass.\nAs can be seen fr om the two examples,\nseparating  the motion of dif ferent parts of a\nsystem into motion of the centre of mass and\nmotion about the centre of mass  is a very\nuseful technique that helps in understanding\nthe motion of the system.",

    "content": "6.5  VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS\nWe are already familiar with vectors and their\nuse in physics. In chapter 5 (Work, Energy, Power)\nwe defined the scalar product of two vectors. An\nimportant physical quantity, work, is defined as\na scalar product of two vector quantities, force\nand displacement.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 6.14 (a) Trajectories of two stars, S1 (dotted line)\nand S 2 (solid line) forming a binary\nsystem with their centre of mass C in\nuniform motion.\n(b) The same binary system, with the\ncentre of mass C at rest.\n102 PHYSICS\nWe shall now define another product of two\nvectors. This product is a vector. Two important\nquantities in the study of rotational motion,\nnamely, moment of a for ce and angular\nmomentum, are defined as vector products.\nDefinition of Vector Product\nA vector pr oduct of two vectors a and b is a\nvector c such that\n(i) magnitude of c = c sinab θ=  where a and b\nare magnitudes of  a and b and θ is the\nangle between the two vectors.\n(ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing\na and b.\n(iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head\nlying in the plane of  a and b and the screw\nperpendicular to this plane, and if we tur n\nthe head in the direction from  a to b, then\nthe tip of the screw advances in the direction\nof c. This right handed scr ew rule is\nillustrated in Fig. 6.15a.\nAlternately, if one curls up the fingers of\nright hand around a line perpendicular to the\nplane of the vectors  a and b and if the fingers\nare curled up in the direction from a to b, then\nthe stretched thumb points in the dir ection of\nc, as shown in Fig. 6.15b.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 6.15 (a) Rule of the right handed screw for\ndefining the dir ection of the vector\nproduct of two vectors.\n(b) Rule of the right hand for defining the\ndirection of the vector product.\nA simpler version of the right hand rule is\nthe following : Open up your right hand palm\nand curl the fingers pointing from  a to b. Your\nstretched thumb points in the direction of c.\nIt should be remembered that there are two\nangles between any two vectors  a and b . In\nFig. 6.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to\nθ (as shown)\nand (3600– θ). While applying either of the above\nrules, the rotation should be taken through the\nsmaller angle (<180 0) between  a and b. It is\nθ\nhere.\nBecause of the cross (×) used to denote the\nvector product, it is also referred to as cross product.\n• Note that scalar product of two vectors is\ncommutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a\nThe vector pr oduct, however , is not\ncommutative, i.e. a × b ≠ b × a\nThe magnitude of both a × b and b × a is the\nsame ( sinab θ ); also, both of them ar e\nperpendicular to the plane of  a and b. But the\nrotation of the right-handed scr ew in case of\na × b  is from  a to b, whereas in case of  b × a it\nis from b to a. This means the two vectors ar e\nin opposite directions. We have\n× = − ×a b b a\n• Another inter esting pr operty of a vector\nproduct is its behaviour under r eflection.\nUnder reflection (i.e. on taking the plane\nmirror image) we have\nand ,x x y y z z→ − → − → − . As a result all\nthe components of a vector change sign and\nthus ,a a→ − b b→ − . What happens to\na × b under reflection?\na × b ( ) ( )→ − × − = ×a b a b\nThus, a × b does not change sign under\nreflection.\n• Both scalar and vector products are\ndistributive with respect to vector addition.\nThus,\n.( ) . .+ = +a b c a b a c\n( )× + = × + ×a b c a b a c\n• We may write c = a × b in the component\nform. For this we first need to obtain some\nelementary cross products:\n(i) a × a = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector\nwith zero magnitude)\nThis follows since magnitude of a × a  is\n2 sin0 0a ° = .\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 103\nu\nFrom this follow the results\n(i) ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ, ,× = × = × =i i 0 j j 0 k k 0\n(ii) ˆ ˆ ˆ× =i j k\nNote that the magnitude of ˆ ˆ×i j  is sin90 0\nor 1, since ˆi  and ˆj  both have unit\nmagnitude and the angle between them is 900.\nThus, ˆ ˆ×i j  is a unit vector .

    "content": "6.6 ANGULAR VELOCITY AND ITS RELATION\nWITH LINEAR VELOCITY\nIn this section we shall study what is angular\nvelocity and its r ole in r otational motion. W e\nhave seen that every particle of a rotating body\nmoves in a cir cle. The linear velocity of the\nparticle is r elated to the angular velocity. The\nrelation between these two quantities involves\na vector product which we learnt about in the\nlast section.\nLet us go back to Fig. 6.4. As said above, in\nrotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,\nFig. 6.16 Rotation about a fixed axis. (A particle (P)\nof the rigid body rotating about the fixed\n(z-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)\non the axis.)\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 6.16 we\nredraw Fig. 6.4, showing a typical particle (at a\npoint P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed\naxis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes\n104 PHYSICS\na circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius\nof the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of\nthe point P from the axis. W e also show the\nlinear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is\nalong the tangent at P to the cir cle.\nLet P′ be the position of the particle after an\ninterval of time ∆t (Fig. 6.16). The angle PCP ′\ndescribes the angular displacement ∆θ of the\nparticle in time ∆t. The average angular velocity\nof the particle over the interval  ∆t is ∆θ/∆t. As\n∆t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller\nvalues), the ratio ∆θ/∆t approaches a limit which\nis the instantaneous angular velocity d θ/dt of\nthe particle at the position P . We denote the\ninstantaneous angular velocity  by  ω (the\nGreek letter omega). W e know fr om our study\nof circular motion that the magnitude of linear\nvelocity  v of a particle moving in a cir cle is\nrelated to the angular velocity of the particle ω\nby the simple r elation rυ ω= , wher e r is the\nradius of the circle.\nWe observe that at any given instant the\nrelation  v r ω=  applies to  all particles of the\nrigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular\ndistance ri  from the fixed axis, the linear velocity\nat a given instant vi is given by\ni iv r ω= (6.19)\nThe index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the\ntotal number of particles of the body.\nFor particles on the axis, 0=r , and hence\nv = ω r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are\nstationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.\nNote that we use the same angular velocity\nω for all the particles. We therefore, refer to  ω ωω ωω\nas the angular velocity of the whole body.\nWe have characterised pure translation of\na body by all parts of the body having the same\nvelocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we\nmay characterise pure rotation by all parts of\nthe body having the same angular velocity at\nany instant of time . Note that this\ncharacterisation of the rotation of a rigid body\nabout a fixed axis is just another way of saying\nas in Sec. 6.1 that each particle of the body moves\nin a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular\nto the axis and has the centre on the axis.\nIn our discussion so far the angular velocity\nappears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We\nshall not justify this fact, but we shall accept\nit. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular\nvelocity vector lies along the axis of r otation,\nand points out in the direction in which a right\nhanded screw would advance, if the head of the\nscrew is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 6.17a).\nThe magnitude of this vector is\nd dtω θ=\nreferred as above.\nFig. 6.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw\nrotates with the body, the scr ew\nadvances in the direction of the angular\nvelocity ω ωω ωω. If the sense (clockwise or\nanticlockwise) of rotation of the body\nchanges, so does the direction of ω ωω ωω.\nFig. 6.17 (b) The angular velocity vector ω ωω ωω is directed\nalong the fixed axis as shown. The linear\nvelocity of the particle at P is v = ω ωω ωω × r.\nIt is  perpendicular to both ω ω ω ω ω and r and\nis  directed along the tangent to the circle\ndescribed by the particle.\nWe shall now look at what the vector\nproduct ω ωω ωω × r corresponds to. Refer to Fig.\n6.17(b) which is a part of Fig. 6.16 reproduced\nto show the path of the particle P . The figur e\nshows the vector ω ωω ωω directed along the fixed (z–)\naxis and also the position vector  r = OP  of the\nparticle at P of the rigid body with respect to\nthe origin O. Note that the origin is chosen to\nbe on the axis of rotation.\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 105\nNow ω ωω ωω × r = ω ωωωω × OP = ω ωω ωω × (OC + CP)\nBut ω ωω ωω × OC = 0 0 0 0 0 as ω ω ω ω ω is along OC\nHence ω ωω ωω × r = ω ωω ωω × CP\nThe vector ω ωω ωω × CP is perpendicular to ω ωω ωω, i.e.\nto the z-axis and also to CP, the radius of the\ncircle described by the particle at P . It is\ntherefore, along the tangent to the cir cle at P.\nAlso, the magnitude of  ω ωω ωω × CP is ω (CP) since\nω ωω ωω and CP are perpendicular to each other . We\nshall denote CP by\n⊥r  and not by r, as we did\nearlier.\nThus, ωωωωω × r is a vector of magnitude ω r⊥\nand is along the tangent to the circle described\nby the particle at P. The linear velocity vector v\nat P has the same magnitude and direction.\nThus,\nv = ω  ω ω  ω ω × r (6.20)\nIn fact, the relation, Eq. (6.20), holds good\neven for rotation of a rigid body with one point\nfixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 6.6(a)].\nIn this case r represents the position vector of\nthe particle with respect to the fixed point taken\nas the origin.\nWe note that for rotation about a fixed\naxis, the direction of the vector ω\nωω ωω does not\nchange with time. Its magnitude may,\nhowever, change from instant to instant. For\nthe more general rotation, both the\nmagnitude and the direction of ω ω ω ω ω may change\nfrom instant to instant.",

    "content": "6.7.1 Moment of force (Torque)\nWe have learnt that the motion of a rigid body,\nin general, is a combination of rotation and\ntranslation. If the body is fixed at a point or along\na line, it has only r otational motion. We know\nthat force is needed to change the translational\nstate of a body, i.e. to produce linear\nacceleration. W e may then ask, what is the\nanalogue of force in the case of rotational\nmotion? To look into the question in a concrete\nsituation let us take the example of opening or\nclosing of a door. A door is a rigid body which\ncan rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing\nthrough the hinges. What makes the door\nrotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied\nthe door does not rotate. But any force does not\ndo the job. A force applied to the hinge line\ncannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a\nforce of given magnitude applied at right angles\nto the door at its outer edge is most effective in\nproducing rotation. It is not the force alone, but\nhow and where the force is applied is important\nin rotational motion.\nThe rotational analogue of force in linear\nmotion is moment of force. It is also referred to\nas torque or couple. (We shall use the wor ds\nmoment of force and torque interchangeably.)\nWe shall first define the moment of force for the\nspecial case of a single particle. Later on we\nshall extend the concept to systems of particles\nincluding rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to\na change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is\nangular acceleration of a rigid body.\n106 PHYSICS\nFig. 6.18 τ = τ = τ = τ = τ = r × F, τ τ τ τ τ is perpendicular to the plane\ncontaining r and F, and its direction is\ngiven by the right handed screw rule.\nIf a force acts on a single particle at a point\nP whose position with respect to the origin O is\ngiven by the position vector r (Fig. 6.18), the\nmoment of the force acting on the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined as the vector\nproduct\nτ ττ ττ = r × F (6.23)\nThe moment of force (or torque) is a vector\nquantity. The symbol τ τ τ τ τ stands for the Gr eek\nletter tau. The magnitude of τ τ τ\nτ τ is\nτ = r F sinθ (6.24a)\nwhere r is the magnitude of the position vector\nr, i.e. the length OP, F is the magnitude of force\nF and θ     is the angle between r and F as\nshown.\nMoment of for ce has dimensions M L 2 T -2.\nIts dimensions ar e the same as those of work\nor energy. It is, however, a very different physical\nquantity than work. Moment of a for ce is a\nvector, while work is a scalar . The SI unit of\nmoment of for ce is newton metr e (N m). The\nmagnitude of the moment of for ce may be\nwritten\n( sin )r F r Fτ θ ⊥= = (6.24b)\nor sinr F rFτ θ ⊥= = (6.24c)\nwhere r⊥  = r sinθ is the perpendicular distance\nof the line of action of F from the origin and\n( sin )F F θ⊥ = is the component of F in the\ndirection perpendicular to r. Note that τ = 0 if\nr = 0, F = 0 or θ = 00 or 1800 . Thus, the moment\nof a force vanishes if either the magnitude of\nthe force is zero, or if the line of action of the\nforce passes through the origin.\nOne may note that since  r × F is a vector\nproduct, properties of a vector pr oduct of two\nvectors apply to it.

    "content": "6.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle\nJust as the moment of a force is the rotational\nanalogue of force in linear motion, the quantity\nangular momentum is the rotational analogue\nof linear momentum. W e shall first define\nangular momentum for the special case of a\nsingle particle and look at its usefulness in the\ncontext of single particle motion. We shall then\nextend the definition of angular momentum to\nsystems of particles including rigid bodies.\nLike moment of a force, angular momentum\nis also a vector product. It could also be referred\nto as moment of (linear) momentum. From this\nterm one could guess how angular momentum\nis defined.\nConsider a particle of mass m and linear\nmomentum p at a position r relative to the origin\nO. The angular momentum l of the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined to be\nl = r × p (6.25a)\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum\nvector is\nsinl r p= θ (6.26a)\nwhere p is the magnitude of p and θ is the angle\nbetween r and p. We may write\nl r p ⊥=  or r p⊥                                   (6.26b)\nwhere r⊥  (= r sinθ) is the perpendicular distance\nof the directional line of  p from the origin and\n( sin )p p θ⊥ =  is the component of p in a direction\nperpendicular to r. W e expect the angular\nmomentum to be zero ( l = 0), if the linear\nmomentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at\nthe origin (r = 0), or if the directional line of  p\npasses through the origin θ = 00 or 1800.\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 107\nThe physical quantities, moment of a force\nand angular momentum, have an important\nrelation between them. It is the rotational\nanalogue of the relation between force and linear\nmomentum. For deriving the relation in the\ncontext of a single particle, we differentiate\nl  = r × p with respect to time,\nr pd d ( )d dt t= ×l\nApplying the product rule for differentiation\nto the right hand side,\nr pr p p rd d d( )d d dt t t× = × + ×\nNow, the velocity of the particle is v = dr/dt\nand p = m v\nBecause of this d 0,d mt × = × =r p v v\nas the vector pr oduct of two parallel vectors\nvanishes. Further, since dp / dt = F,\nr p r F× = × =d\ndt t t\nHence\nd\ndt ( )r p× = τ\nor  (6.27)\nThus, the time rate of change of the angular\nmomentum of a particle is equal to the tor que\nacting on it. This is the r otational analogue of\nthe equation F = d p/dt, which expr esses\nNewton’s second law for the translational motion\nof a single particle.\nTorque and angular momentum for a system\nof particles\nTo get the total angular momentum of a system\nof particles about a given point we need to add\nvectorially the angular momenta of individual\nparticles. Thus, for a system of n particles,\nThe angular momentum of the ith   particle\nis given by\nli = ri × pi\nwhere ri is the position vector of the ith particle\nwith respect to a given origin and p = (mivi) is\nthe linear momentum of the particle. (The\nparticle has mass mi and velocity vi) We may\nwrite the total angular momentum of a system\nof particles as\n(6.25b)\nThis is a generalisation of the definition of\nangular momentum (Eq. 6.25a) for a single\nparticle to a system of particles.\nUsing Eqs. (6.23) and (6.25b), we get\nAn experiment with the bicycle rim\nTake a\nbicycle rim\nand extend\nits axle on\nboth sides.\nTie two\nstrings\nat both ends\nA and B,\nas shown\nin the\nadjoining\nfigure.  Hold\nboth the\nstrings\ntogether in\none hand such that the rim is vertical. If you\nleave one string, the rim will tilt. Now keeping\nthe rim in vertical position with both the strings\nin one hand, put the wheel in fast rotation\naround the axle with the other hand. Then leave\none string, say B, from your hand, and observe\nwhat happens.\nThe rim keeps rotating in a vertical plane\nand the plane of rotation turns around the string\nA which you ar e holding. We say that the axis\nof rotation of the rim or equivalently\nits angular momentum precesses about the\nstring A.\nThe rotating rim gives rise to an angular\nmomentum. Determine the direction of this\nangular momentum. When you are holding the\nrotating rim with string A, a torque is generated.\n(We leave it to you to find out how the torque is\ngenerated and what its direction is.) The effect\nof the torque on the angular momentum is to\nmake it precess around an axis perpendicular\nto both the angular momentum and the torque.\nVerify all these statements.\nInitially After\n108 PHYSICS\nu\nu\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nL\nt t t ii\n= ( ) = = ∑ ∑l l τ (6.28a)\nwhere τ ττ ττi is the torque acting on the ith particle;\ni i i= ×r Fτ\nThe force Fi on the ith particle is the vector\nsum of external forces Fi\next\nacting on the particle\nand the internal forces int\niF  exerted on it by the\nother particles of the system.

In this case the contribution of the\ninternal forces to the total torque on the system is\nzero, since the torque resulting from each action-\nreaction pair of forces is zero. We thus have, τ ττ ττint =\n0 and therefore τ ττττ  = τ\nτ τ  τ τext.\nSince = ∑ iτ        τ , it follows from Eq. (6.28a)\nthat\nd\nd\nL\nt\next= τ (6.28 b)\nThus, the time rate of the total angular\nmomentum of a system of particles about a\npoint  (taken as the origin of our frame of\nreference) is equal to the sum of the external\ntorques (i.e. the torques due to external forces)\nacting on the system taken about the same\npoint. Eq. (6.28 b) is the generalisation of the\nsingle particle case of Eq. (6.23) to a system of\nparticles. Note that when we have only one\nparticle, there are no internal forces or torques.\nEq.(6.28 b) is the rotational analogue of\nd\nd\nP Ft\next= (6.17)\nNote that like Eq.(6.17), Eq.(6.28b) holds\ngood for any system of particles, whether it is a\nrigid body or its individual particles have all\nkinds of internal motion.\nConservation of angular momentum\nIf τ ττττext = 0, Eq. (6.28b) reduces to\nLd 0dt =\nor         L = constant. (6.29a)\nThus, if the total external torque on a system\nof particles is zer o, then the total angular\nmomentum of the system is conserved, i.e.\nremains constant. Eq. (6.29a) is equivalent to\nthree scalar equations,\nLx = K1, Ly = K2 and Lz = K3 (6.29 b)\nHere K1, K2 and K3 are constants; Lx, Ly and\nLz ar e the components of the total angular\nmomentum vector L along the x,y and z axes\nrespectively. The statement that the total\nangular momentum is conserved means that\neach of these three components is conserved.\nEq. (6.29a) is the rotational analogue of\nEq. (6.18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total\nlinear momentum for a system of  particles.\nLike Eq. (6.18a), it has applications in many\npractical situations. W e shall look at a few of\nthe interesting applications later on in\nthis chapter.",

    "content": "6.8  EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY\nWe are now going to concentrate on the motion\nof rigid bodies rather than on the motion of\ngeneral systems of particles.\nWe shall r ecapitulate what ef fect the\nexternal forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth\nwe shall omit the adjective ‘external ’ because\nunless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only\nexternal forces and torques.) The forces change\nthe translational state of the motion of the rigid\nbody, i.e. they change its total linear\nmomentum in accordance with Eq. (6.17). But\nthis is not the only effect the forces have. The\ntotal torque on the body may not vanish. Such\na torque changes the rotational state of motion\nof the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular\nmomentum of the body in accordance with\nEq. (6.28 b).\nA rigid body is said to be in mechanical\nequilibrium, if both its linear momentum and\nangular momentum are not changing with time,\nor equivalently, the body has neither linear\nacceleration nor angular acceleration. This means\n(1) the total force, i.e. the vector sum of the\nforces, on the rigid body is zero;\nF F F F1 2\n1\n+ + + = =\n=\n∑... n i\ni\nn\n0 (6.30a)\nIf the total force on the body is zero, then\nthe total linear momentum of the body does\nnot change with time. Eq. (6.30a) gives the\ncondition for the translational equilibrium\nof the body.\n(2) The total torque, i.e. the vector sum of the\ntorques on the rigid body is zero,\n1 2 1\n+ + + = =\n=\n∑... n i\ni\nn\n0τ     τ           τ          τ (6.30b)\nIf the total torque on the rigid body is zero,\nthe total angular momentum of the body does\nnot change with time. Eq. (6.30 b) gives the\ncondition for the rotational equilibrium of the\nbody.\nOne may raise a question, whether the\nrotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 6.30(b)]\nremains valid, if the origin with respect to which\nthe torques are taken is shifted. One can show\nthat if the translational equilibrium condition\n[Eq. 6.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a\nshift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational\nequilibrium condition is independent of the\nlocation of the origin about which the torques\nare taken. Example 6.7 gives a proof of this result\nin a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces\nacting on a rigid body in translational\nequilibrium. The generalisation of this result to\nn forces is left as an exercise.\nEq. (6.30a) and Eq. (6.30b), both, are vector\nequations. They are equivalent to three scalar\nequations each. Eq. (6.30a) corresponds to\nFix\ni\nn\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n1\n, Fiy\ni\nn\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n1\nand Fiz\ni\nn\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n1\n(6.31a)\nwhere Fix, Fiy and Fiz are respectively the x, y and\nz components of the forces Fi. Similarly, Eq.\n(6.30b) is equivalent to three scalar equations\nix\ni\nn\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n1\nτ , iy\ni\nn\n=\n=\n∑ 0\n1\nτ  and       (6.31b)\nwhere τix, τiy  and  τiz are respectively the x, y and\nz components of the torque τ ττ ττi .\nEq. (6.31a) and (6.31b) give six independent\nconditions to be satisfied for mechanical\n110 PHYSICS\nequilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of\nproblems all the forces acting on the body are\ncoplanar. Then we need only thr ee conditions\nto be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two\nof these conditions correspond to translational\nequilibrium; the sum of the components of the\nforces along any two perpendicular axes in the\nplane must be zero. The third condition\ncorresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum\nof the components of the torques along any axis\nperpendicular to the plane of the forces must\nbe zero.\nThe conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body\nmay be compared with those for a particle, which\nwe considered in earlier chapters. Since\nconsideration of rotational motion does not apply\nto a particle, only the conditions for translational\nequilibrium (Eq. 6.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus,\nfor equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of\nall the forces on it must be zero. Since all these\nforces act on the single particle, they must be\nconcurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent\nforces was discussed in the earlier chapters.\nA body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it\nmay be in translational equilibrium and not in\nrotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational\nequilibrium and not in translational\nequilibrium.\nConsider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod\n(AB) as shown in Fig. 6.20(a). At the two ends (A\nand B) of which two parallel forces, both  equal\nin magnitude and acting along same direction\nare applied perpendicular to the rod.\nFig. 6.20 (a)\nLet C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.\nthe moment of the for ces at A and B will both\nbe equal in magnitude ( aF ), but opposite in\nsense as shown. The net moment on the rod will\nbe zero. The system will be in rotational\nequilibrium, but it will not be in translational\nequilibrium;\nF 0≠∑\nFig. 6.20 (b)\nThe force at B in Fig. 6.20(a) is reversed in\nFig. 6.20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with\ntwo forces of equal magnitude but acting in\nopposite diretions applied perpendicular to the\nrod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here\nthe moments of both the forces are equal, but\nthey are not opposite; they act in the same sense\nand cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The\ntotal force on the body is zero; so the body is in\ntranslational equilibrium; but it is not in\nrotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not\nfixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.\nrotation without translation).\nA pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting\nin opposite directions with different lines of\naction is known as a couple or torque. A couple\nproduces rotation without translation.\nWhen we open the lid of a bottle by turning\nit, our fingers ar e applying a couple to the lid\n[Fig. 6.21(a)]. Another known example is a\ncompass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as\nshown in the Fig. 6.21(b). The earth’s magnetic\nfield exerts equal forces on the north and south\npoles. The for ce on the North Pole is towar ds\nthe north, and the for ce on the South Pole is\ntoward the south. Except when the needle points\nin the north-south direction; the two forces do\nnot have the same line of action. Thus there is\na couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s\nmagnetic field.\nFig. 6.21(a) Our fingers apply a couple to turn\nthe lid.\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 111\nu\nFig. 6.21(b) The Earth’s magnetic field exerts equal\nand opposite for ces on the poles of a\ncompass needle. These two  forces form\na couple.",

A see-\nsaw on the children’s playground is a typical\nexample of a lever. Two forces F1 and F2, parallel\nto each other and usually perpendicular to the\nlever , as shown her e, act on the lever at\ndistances d1 and d2 respectively from the fulcrum\nas shown in Fig. 6.23.\nFig. 6.23\nThe lever is a system in mechanical\nequilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support\nat the fulcrum; R is dir ected opposite to the\nforces  F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium,\nR – F1 – F2 = 0 (i)\nFor considering r otational equilibrium we\ntake the moments about the fulcrum; the sum\nof moments must be zero,\nd1F1 – d2F2 = 0 (ii)\nNor mally the anticlockwise (clockwise)\nmoments are taken to be positive (negative). Note\nR acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment\nabout the fulcrum.\nIn the case of the lever force F1 is usually\nsome weight to be lifted. It is called the load and\nits distance from the fulcrum d1 is called the\nload arm. Force F2 is the effort applied to lift the\nload; distance d2 of the effort from the fulcrum\nis the effort arm.\nEq. (ii) can be written as\nd1F1 = d2 F2 (6.32a)\nor load arm × load = effort arm × effort\nThe above equation expresses the principle\nof moments for a lever .

T ake an irr egular -\nshaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow\ntipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial\nand error a point G on the cardboard where it\ncan be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The\ncardboard remains horizontal in this position.)\nThis point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)\nof the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides\na vertically upward force due to which the\ncardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As\nshown in the Fig. 6.24, the reaction of the tip is\nequal and opposite to Mg and hence the\ncardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is\nalso in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,\ndue to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and\nfall. There are torques on the card board due to\nthe forces of gravity like m1g, m2g ….  etc, acting\non the individual particles that make up the\ncardboard.\nFig. 6.24 Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a\npencil. The point of support, G, is the\ncentre of gravity.\nThe CG of the cardboard is so located that\nthe total torque on it due to the forces m1g, m2g\n….  etc. is zero.\nIf  ri is the position vector of the ith particle\nof an extended body with respect to its CG, then\nthe tor que about the CG, due to the for ce of\ngravity on the particle  is τττττi = ri × mi g. The total\ngravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.\nτ τ τ τg i i i m= = × =∑ ∑ r g 0 (6.33)\nWe may ther efore, define the CG of a body\nas that point where the total gravitational torque\non the body is zero.\nWe notice that in Eq. (6.33), g is the same\nfor all particles, and hence it comes out of the\nsummation. This gives, since g is non-zer o,\n∑ m i ir  = 0. Remember that the position vectors\n(ri) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in\naccordance with the reasoning given below\nEq. (6.4a) in Sec. 6.2, if the sum is zero, the origin\nmust be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,\nthe centre of gravity of the body coincides with\nthe centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-\nFig. 6.25 Determining the centre of gravity of a body\nof irregular shape. The centre of gravity G\nlies on the vertical AA1 through the point\nof suspension of the body A.\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 113\nu\nu\nfree space. W e note that this is true because\nthe body being small,  g does not\nvary from one point of the body to the other. If\nthe body is so extended that g varies from part\nto part of the body, then the centre of gravity\nand centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,\nthe two are different concepts. The centre of\nmass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends\nonly on the distribution of mass of the body.\nIn Sec. 6.2 we found out the position of the\ncentre of mass of several regular, homogeneous\nobjects. Obviously the method used there gives\nus also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if\nthey are small enough.\nFigure 6.25 illustrates another way of\ndetermining the CG of an irregular shaped body\nlike a cardboard. If you suspend the body from\nsome point like A, the vertical line thr ough A\npasses through the CG. W e mark the vertical\nAA1. We then suspend the body thr ough other\npoints like B and C. The intersection of the\nverticals gives the CG. Explain why the method\nworks. Since the body is small enough, the\nmethod allows us to deter mine also its centr e\nof mass.",

To keep the discussion simple, we shall\nconsider rotation about a fixed axis only. Let us\ntry to get an expression for the kinetic energy of\na rotating body. We know that for a body rotating\nabout a fixed axis, each particle of the body moves\nin a circle with linear velocity given by Eq. (6.19).\n(Refer to Fig. 6.16).

It is then\nevident that the parameter , moment of inertia\nI, is the desired rotational analogue of mass in\nlinear motion. In rotation (about a fixed axis),\nthe moment of inertia plays a similar role as\nmass does in linear motion.\nWe now apply the definition Eq.

(The derivations of these\nexpressions are beyond the scope of this\ntextbook and you will study them in higher\nclasses.)\nAs the mass of a body resists a change in its\nstate of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia\nin linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of\ninertia about a given axis of rotation resists a\nchange in its rotational motion, it can be\nregarded as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body; it is a measure of the way in which\ndifferent parts of the body are distributed at\ndifferent distances from the axis. Unlike the\nmass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a\nfixed quantity but depends on distribution of\nmass about the axis of rotation, and the\norientation and position of the axis of rotation\nwith respect to the body as a whole. As a\nmeasure of the way in which the mass of a\nrotating rigid body is distributed with respect to\nthe axis of rotation, we can define a new\nparameter, the radius of gyration. It is related\nto the moment of inertia and the total mass of\nthe body.\nNotice from the Table 6.1 that in all\ncases, we can write I = Mk 2, where k has\nthe dimension of length. For a rod, about\nthe perpendicular axis at its midpoint,\ni.e.2 2 12,k L=  = 12k L . Similarly, k = R/2\nfor the cir cular disc about its diameter . The\nlength k is a geometric property of the body and\naxis of rotation. It is called the radius of\ngyration. The radius of gyration of a body\nabout an axis may be defined as the distance\nfrom the axis of a mass point whose mass is\nequal to the mass of the whole body and whose\nmoment of inertia is equal to the moment of\ninertia of the body about the axis.\nThus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body\ndepends on the mass of the body, its shape and\nsize; distribution of mass about the axis of\nrotation, and the position and orientation of the\naxis of rotation.\nFrom the definition, Eq. (6.34), we can infer\nthat the dimensions of moments of inertia are\nML2 and its SI units are kg m2.\nThe property of this extremely important\nquantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body, has been put to a great practical use.\nThe machines, such as steam engine and the\nautomobile engine, etc., that produce rotational\nmotion have a disc with a large moment of\ninertia, called a flywheel. Because of its large\nmoment of inertia, the flywheel resists the\nsudden increase or decrease of the speed of the\nvehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed\nand prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring\na smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.\n116 PHYSICS",

    "content": "Table 6.2 lists quantities associated with linear\nmotion and their analogues in rotational\nmotion. We have already compared kinematics\nof the two motions. Also, we know that in\nrotational motion moment of inertia and torque\nplay the same role as mass and force\nrespectively in linear motion. Given this we\nshould be able to guess what the other\nanalogues indicated in the table are. For\nexample, we know that in linear motion, work\ndone is given by F dx, in rotational motion about\na fixed axis it should be\ndτ θ , since we already\nknow the correspondence d dx θ→  and F τ→ .\nIt is, however , necessary that these\ncorrespondences are established on sound\ndynamical considerations. This is what we now\nturn to.\nBefore we begin, we note a simplification\nthat arises in the case of rotational motion\nabout a fixed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only\nthose components of torques, which are along\nthe direction of the fixed axis need to be\nconsidered in our discussion. Only these\ncomponents can cause the body to rotate about\nthe axis. A component of the torque\nperpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to\nturn the axis from its position. We specifically\nassume that there will arise necessary forces of\nconstraint to cancel the effect of the\nperpendicular components of the (external)\ntorques, so that the fixed position of the axis\nwill be maintained. The perpendicular\ncomponents of the torques, therefore need not\nbe taken into account. This means that for our\ncalculation of torques on a rigid body:\n(1) We need to consider only those for ces that\nlie in planes perpendicular to the axis.\nForces which are parallel to the axis will give\ntorques perpendicular to the axis and need\nnot be taken into account.\n(2) We need to consider only those components\nof the position vectors which are\nperpendicular to the axis. Components of\nposition vectors along the axis will result in\ntorques perpendicular to the axis and need\nnot be taken into account.\nWork done by a torque\nFig. 6.30 Work done by a for ce F1 acting on a\nparticle of a body rotating about a fixed\naxis; the particle describes a circular path\nwith centre C on the axis;  arc P1P′1(ds1)\ngives the displacement of the particle.\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 119\nFigure 6.30 shows a cross-section of a rigid\nbody rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken\nas the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the\npage; see Fig. 6.29). As said above we need to\nconsider only those forces which lie in planes\nperpendicular to the axis. Let F1 be one such\ntypical force acting as shown on a particle of\nthe body at point P 1 with its line of action in a\nplane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience\nwe call  this to be the x\n′–y′ plane (coincident\nwith the plane of the page). The particle at P 1\ndescribes a circular path of radius r1 with centre\nC on the axis; CP1 = r1.\nIn time ∆t, the point moves to the position\nP1′. The displacement of the particle ds1,\ntherefore, has magnitude d s1 = r1dθ and\ndirection tangential at P 1 to the circular path\nas shown. Here dθ is the angular displacement\nof the particle, d θ = 1 1P CP∠ ′ .The work done by\nthe force on the particle is\ndW1 = F1. ds1= F1ds1 cosφ1= F1(r1 dθ)sinα1\nwhere φ1 is the angle between F1 and the tangent\nat P1, and α1 is the angle between  F1 and the\nradius vector OP1; φ1 + α1 = 90°.\nThe torque due to F1 about the origin is\nOP 1 × F1. Now OP 1 = OC + OP 1. [Refer to\nFig. 6.17(b).] Since OC is along the axis, the torque\nresulting from it is excluded from our\nconsideration. The effective torque due to F1 is\nτ ττ ττ1= CP × F1; it is directed along the axis of rotation\nand has a magnitude τ1= r1F1 sinα , Therefore,\ndW1 = τ1dθ\nIf there are more than one forces acting on\nthe body, the work done by all of them can be\nadded to give the total work done on the body.\nDenoting the magnitudes of the torques due to\nthe different forces as\nτ1, τ2, …  etc,\n1 2d ( ...) dW τ τ θ= + +\nRemember , the for ces giving rise to the\ntorques act on different particles, but the\nangular displacement d\nθ is the same for all\nparticles. Since all the torques considered are\nparallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude\nτ of the\ntotal torque is just the algebraic sum of the\nmagnitudes of the torques, i.e., τ = τ1 + τ2 + .....\nWe, therefore, have\nd dW τ θ= (6.39)\nThis expression gives the work done by the\ntotal (external) torque τ which acts on the body\nrotating about a fixed axis.

When\nthe total external torque is zero, the total angular\nmomentum of the system is conserved.\nWe now wish to study the angular momentum\nin the special case of rotation about a fixed axis.\nThe general expression for the total angular\nmomentum of the system of n particles is\nL r p= ×\n=\n∑ i i\ni\nN\n1\n(6.25b)\nWe first consider the angular momentum of\na typical particle of the rotating rigid body.

In general, for a particle, the angular\nmomentum l is not along the axis of rotation,\ni.e. for a particle, l and ω ωω ωω are not necessarily\nparallel. Compare this with the corresponding\nfact in translation. For a particle, p and v are\nalways parallel to each other.\nFor computing the total angular momentum\nof the whole rigid body, we add up the\ncontribution of each particle of the body.\nThus\nWe denote by ⊥L  and zL  the components of\nL  respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and\nalong the z-axis;\nL OC v⊥ = ×∑ i i i m (6.42a)\nwhere mi and vi are respectively the mass and\nthe velocity of the ith particle and Ci is the centre\nof the circle described by the particle;\nand\nor ˆω=L kz I (6.42b)\nThe last step follows since the perpendicular\ndistance of the ith particle from the axis is ri; and\nby definition the moment of inertia of the body\nabout the axis of rotation is I m r i i=∑\n2 .\nNote z ⊥= +L L L (6.42c)\nThe rigid bodies which we have mainly\nconsidered in this chapter are symmetric about\nthe axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is\none of their symmetry axes. For such bodies, for\na given OCi, for every particle which has a\nvelocity vi , there is another particle of velocity\n–vi  located diametrically opposite on the circle\nwith centre Ci described by the particle.

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the\nbody do not change, even though there are forces on them.\n2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid\nbody not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination\nof translational and rotational motions.\n3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in\nthe rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.\n4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any\ninstant of time.\n5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is\nω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis\nof rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ω ωω ωω has a fixed direction.\n6. The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The\nmagnitude of this vector is absinθ  and its direction is given by the right handed screw\nor the right hand rule.\n7. The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by\nv = ω ωω ωω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along the\nfixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one\npoint fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed\npoint taken as the origin.\n8. The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position\nvector is\nR\nr\n= ∑ m\nM\ni i\n9. Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, where P is the\nlinear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the\nsystem is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total\nexternal force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is\nconstant.\n10. The angular momentum of a system of n particles about the origin is\nL r p\n= ×\n=\n∑ i\ni\nn\ni\n1\nThe torque or moment of force on a system of n particles about the origin is\n= ×∑ r Fi i\n1\nτ\nThe force  Fi  acting on the ith particle includes the external as well as internal forces.\nAssuming Newton’s third law of motion and that forces between any two particles act\nalong the line joining the particles, we can show τ ττ ττint = 0 and\nmechanism is neglected, there is no external\ntorque about the axis of rotation of the chair and\nhence I\nω is constant.  Stretching the arms\nincreases I about the axis of rotation, resulting in\ndecreasing the angular speed ω.  Bringing the\narms closer to the body has the opposite effect.\nA circus acrobat and a diver take advantage\nof this principle.  Also, skaters and classical,\nIndian or western, dancers performing a\npirouette (a spinning about a tip–top) on the toes\nof one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.\nCan you explain?\n124 PHYSICS",

For this purpose we need to know only the external\nforces on the body.\n2. Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,\nthe translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of\nmass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One\nexample of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as\nthe kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of the\ncentre of mass MV2/2,\nK = K\n′ + MV2/2\n3. Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s\nSecond Law and also Newton’s Thir d Law for particles.\n4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of\nparticles is the total exter nal torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second\nlaw for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between\nany two particles act along the line joining the particles.\n5. The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque\nare independent conditions. W e can have one without the other . In a couple, total\nexternal force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.\n6. The total torque on a  system is independent of the origin if the total external force is\nzero.\n7. The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational\nfield does not vary fr om one part of the body to the other .\nd\ndt\next\nL = τ τ\n11. A rigid body is in mechanical equilibrium if\n(1) it is in translational equilibrium, i.e., the total external force on it is zero : F 0i =∑ ,\nand\n(2) it is in rotational equilibrium, i.e. the total external torque on it is zero :\nτ τi i i= × =∑ ∑ r F 0 .\n12. The centre of gravity of an extended body is that point where the total gravitational\ntorque on the body is zero.\n13.

Anything\nthrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot\nmore tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds\nabove fall towards the earth and  there are many other such\nphenomena.  Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo\n(1564-1642) who recognised the fact that all bodies,\nirrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth\nwith a constant acceleration.  It is said  that he made a public\ndemonstration of this fact.  To find the truth, he certainly\ndid experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and\narrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is\nclose to the more accurate value obtained later.\nA seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars,\nplanets and their motion has been the subject of attention\nin many countries since the earliest of times.  Observations\nsince early times recognised stars which appeared in the\nsky with positions unchanged year after year .  The more\ninteresting objects are the planets which seem to have regular\nmotions against the background of stars.  The earliest\nrecorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy\nabout 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all\ncelestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved\naround the earth.  The only motion that was thought to be\npossible for celestial objects was motion in a circle.\nComplicated schemes of motion  were put forward by Ptolemy\nin order to describe the observed motion of the planets.  The\nplanets were described as moving in circles with the centre\nof the circles themselves moving in larger circles.  Similar\ntheories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some\n400 years later.  However a more elegant model in which the\nSun was the centre around which the planets revolved – the\n‘heliocentric’ model – was already mentioned by Aryabhatta\n(5th century A.D.) in his tr eatise.

    "content": "7.2  KEPLER’S LAWS\nThe three laws of Kepler can be stated as\nfollows:\n1.  Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical\norbits with the Sun situated at one of the  foci\nFig. 7.1(a) An ellipse traced out by a planet around\nthe sun. The closest point is P and the\nfarthest point is A, P is called the\nperihelion and A the aphelion. The\nsemimajor axis is half the distance AP.\nFig. 7.1(b) Drawing an ellipse. A string has its ends\nfixed at F1 and F2. The tip of a pencil holds\nthe string taut and is moved around.\nof the ellipse (Fig. 7.1a). This law was a\ndeviation from the Copernican model which\nallowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of\nwhich the circle is a special case, is a closed\ncurve which can be drawn very simply as\nfollows.\nSelect two points F 1 and F2.  Take a length\nof a string and  fix its ends at F 1 and F 2 by\npins.  With the tip of a pencil  stretch the string\ntaut and then draw a curve by moving the\npencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig.\n7.1(b))  The closed curve you get is called an\nellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse,\nthe sum of the distances from F 1 and F 2 is a\nconstant.  F 1, F2 are called the focii. Join the\npoints F 1 and   F2  and extend   the line to\nintersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown\nin Fig. 7.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is\nthe centre of the ellipse O and the length PO =\nAO  is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse.\nFor a circle, the two focii  merge into one  and\nthe semi-major axis becomes the radius of the\ncircle.\n2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet\nto the sun sweeps  equal areas in equal\nintervals of time (Fig. 7.2).  This law comes from\nthe observations that planets appear to move\nslower when they are  farther from the sun\nthan when they ar e nearer.\nFig. 7.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an\nelliptical orbit. The shaded area is the area\n∆A swept out in a small interval of time  ∆t.\nGRAVITATION 129\n⊳\n3. Law of periods : The square of the time period\nof revolution of a planet is proportional to the\ncube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced\nout by  the planet.",

    "content": "7.3  UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION\nLegend has it that observing an apple falling from\na tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an\nuniversal law of gravitation that led to an\nexplanation of terrestrial  gravitation as well as\nof Kepler’s laws.  Newton’s r easoning was that\nthe moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was\nsubject to a centripetal acceleration due to\nearth’s gravity of magnitude\n22\n2\n4 m\nm\nm\nRVa R T\nπ= = (7.3)\nwhere V is the speed of the moon related to the\ntime period T  by the relation 2 / mV R T π= . The\ntime period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was\nalready known then to be about 3.84 × 108m.  If\nwe substitute these numbers in Eq. (7.3), we get\na value of am much smaller than the value of\nacceleration due to gravity g on the surface of\nthe earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational\nattraction.\n130 PHYSICS\n⊳\nThis clearly shows that the force due to\nearth’s gravity decreases with distance.  If one\nassumes that the gravitational force due to the\nearth decreases in proportion to the inverse\nsquare of the distance from the centre of the\nearth, we will have am α\n2\nmR − ; g α 2\nER−  and we get\n2\n2\nm\nm E\nRg\na R=  3600 (7.4)\nin agreement with a value of g  9.8  m s-2 and\nthe value of am from Eq. (7.3).  These observations\nled Newton to propose the following Universal Law\nof Gravitation :\nEvery body in the universe attracts every other\nbody with a force which is directly proportional\nto the pr oduct of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the squar e of the distance\nbetween them.\nThe quotation is essentially fr om Newton’s\nfamous treatise  called ‘Mathematical Principles\nof Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short).\nStated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation\nlaw reads : The force F on a point mass m2 due\nto another point mass m1 has the magnitude\n1 2\n2| | m mG r=F (7.5)\nEquation (7.5) can be expressed in vector form as\nɵ( ) ɵ1 2 1 2\n2 2– –m m m mG Gr r= =F r r\nɵ1 2\n3– m mG= r\nr\nwhere G is the universal gravitational constant,\nɵr  is the unit vector from m1 to m2 and r = r2 – r1\nas shown in Fig. 7.3.\nThe  gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the\nforce F is along – r. The force on point mass m1\ndue to m2 is of course\n– F by Newton’s third law.\nThus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1\ndue to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to 1 are related\nas F12 = – F21.\nBefore we can apply Eq. (7.5) to objects under\nconsideration, we have to be careful since the\nlaw refers to point masses whereas we deal with\nextended objects which have finite size. If we have\na collection of point masses, the force on any\none of them is the vector sum of the gravitational\nforces exerted by the other point masses as\nshown in Fig 7.4.\nFig. 7.4 Gravitational force on point mass m 1 is the\nvector sum of the gravitational forces exerted\nby m2, m3 and m4.\nThe total force on m1 is\n2 1\n1 2\n21\nGm m\nr\n=F ɵ 3 121 2\n31\nGm m\nr\n+r  ɵ ɵ4 131 412\n41\nGm m\nr\n+r r",

(7.5) is not\ndirectly applicable. Each point mass in the extended\nobject will exert a force on the given point mass and\nthese force will not all be in the same direction. We\nhave to add up these forces vectorially  for all the point\nmasses in the extended object to get the total force.\nThis is easily done using calculus. For two special\n132 PHYSICS\nMr\nThe bar AB has two small lead spheres\nattached at its ends.  The bar is suspended from\na rigid support by a fine wire.  Two large lead\nspheres are brought close to the small ones but\non opposite sides as shown.  The big spheres\nattract the nearby small ones by equal and\nopposite force as shown.  There is no net force\non the bar but only a torque which is clearly\nequal to F times the length of the bar,where F is\nthe force of attraction between a big sphere and\nits neighbouring small sphere.  Due to this\ntorque, the suspended wire  gets twisted till such\ntime as the restoring torque of the wire equals\nthe gravitational torque .  If\nθ is the angle of twist\nof the suspended wire, the restoring torque is\nproportional to\nθ, equal to τθ.

The force on\nm due to the outer shell of thickness  d is\nzero because the result quoted in the\nprevious section. As far as the smaller\nsphere of radius  ( RE  – d  ) is concerned, the\npoint mass is outside it and hence according\nto the r esult quoted earlier , the for ce due to\nthis smaller sphere is just as if the entire\nmass of the smaller sphere is concentrated\nat the centre.

    "content": "7.7  GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY\nWe had discussed earlier the notion of potential\nenergy as being the energy stored in the body at\nits given position.  If the position of the particle\nchanges on account of forces acting on it, then\nthe change in its potential energy is just the\namount of work done on the body by the force.\nAs we had discussed earlier, forces for which the\nwork done is independent of the path are the\nconservative forces.\nThe force of gravity is a conservative for ce\nand we can calculate the potential ener gy of a\nbody arising out of this force, called the\ngravitational potential energy. Consider points\nclose to the surface of earth, at distances from\nthe surface much smaller than the radius of the\nearth.  In such cases, the for ce of gravity is\npractically a constant equal to mg, directed\ntowards the centre of the earth.  If we consider a\npoint at a height h1 from the surface of the earth\nand another point vertically above it at a height\nh2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the\nparticle of mass m from the first to the second\nposition is denoted by W12\nW12 = Force × displacement\n= mg\n(h2 – h1) (7.20)\nIf we associate a potential energy W(h) at a\npoint at a height h above the surface such that\nW(h) = mgh  + Wo (7.21)\n(where Wo = constant) ;\nthen it is clear that\nW12 = W(h2)  – W(h1) (7.22)\nThe work done in moving the particle is just\nthe dif ference of potential ener gy between its\nfinal and initial positions.Observe that the\nconstant Wo cancels out in Eq. (7.22).  Setting  h\n= 0 in the last equation, we get   W ( h = 0 ) =  Wo.\n.  h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth.\nThus,  Wo  is the  potential energy on the surface\nof the earth.\nIf we consider points at arbitrary distance\nfrom the sur face of the earth, the r esult just\nderived is not valid since the assumption that\nthe gravitational force mg is a constant is no\nlonger valid.  However, from our discussion we\nknow that a point outside the earth, the force of\ngravitation on a particle dir ected towards the\ncentre of the earth is\n2\nEG M mF\nr\n= (7.23)\nwhere ME = mass of earth, m = mass of the\nparticle and r its distance from the centre of the\nearth.  If we now calculate the work done in\nlifting a particle from r = r1 to r = r2 (r2 > r1) along\na vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (7.20)\nW G M m\nr r\nr\nr\n12 21\n2\n= ∫ d\n= − −\n\n\nG M m r r\nE\n1 1\n2 1\n(7.24)\nIn place of Eq. (7.21), we can thus associate\na potential energy W(r) at a distance r, such that\nMs ME\nGRAVITATION 135\n⊳\nE\n1( ) ,G M mW r W r= − + (7.25)\nvalid for r > R ,\nso that once again W12 = W(r2) – W(r1).\nSetting   r = infinity in the last equation, we get\nW ( r = infinity ) =   W1 .   Thus,  W1  is the potential\nenergy at infinity. One should note that only the\ndifference of potential energy between two points\nhas a definite meaning  from Eqs. (7.22) and\n(7.24). One conventionally sets  W1 equal to zero,\nso that the potential energy at a point is just the\namount of work done in displacing the particle\nfrom infinity to that point.\nWe have  calculated the potential energy at\na point of a particle  due to gravitational forces\non it due to the earth and it is proportional to\nthe mass of the particle. The gravitational\npotential due to the gravitational for ce of the\nearth is defined as the potential ener gy of  a\nparticle of unit mass at that point. Fr om the\nearlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational\npotential energy associated with two particles\nof masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a\ndistance r is given by\n1 2– Gm mV r=  (if we choose V = 0 as r → ∞ )\nIt should be noted that an isolated system of\nparticles will have the total potential energy that\nequals the sum of energies (given by the above\nequation) for all possible pairs of its constituent\nparticles. This is an example of the application\nof the superposition principle.",

Their motion is very similar to the\nmotion of planets around the Sun and hence\nKepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally\napplicable to them.  In particular , their orbits\naround the earth are circular or elliptic.  Moon is\nthe only natural satellite of the earth with a near\ncircular orbit with a time period of approximately\n27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the\nrotational period of the moon about its own axis.\nSince, 1957, advances in technology have enabled\nmany countries including India to launch artificial\nearth satellites for practical use in fields like\ntelecommunication, geophysics and meteorology.\nWe will consider a satellite in a circular orbit\nof a distance (RE + h) from the centre of the earth,\nwhere RE = radius of the earth.

In considering motion of an object under the gravitational influence of another object\nthe following quantities are conserved:\n(a)  Angular momentum\n(b)  Total mechanical energy\nLinear momentum is not conserved\n2. Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler’s second law. However , it is not special\nto the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.\n3. In Kepler’s third law (see Eq. (7.1) and  T2 = K S R3. The constant KS is the same for all\nplanets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (7.38)].\n4. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the\ngravitational for ce is small at that location in space. It is because both the astr onaut\nand the satellite ar e in “free fall” towar ds the Earth.\n5. The gravitational potential ener gy associated with two particles separated by a distance\nr is given by\nV G m m\nr= +– 1 2 constant\nThe constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With\nthis choice\nV G m m\nr= – 1 2\nThis choice implies that V →  0 as r →  ∞.  Choosing location of zer o of the gravitational\nenergy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that\nthe gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.\n6. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always\npositive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential\nenergy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is\nnegative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.\n7. The commonly encountered expression m g h for the potential energy is actually an\napproximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the\npoint 6, above.\n8. Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two\nfinite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a\nspherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if\nthe mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.\n9. The gravitational for ce on a particle inside a spherical shell is zer o. However, (unlike a\nmetallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside\nit from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not\npossible.",

    "content": "8.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn Chapter 6, we studied the rotation of the bodies and then\nrealised that the motion of a body depends on how mass is\ndistributed within the body.  We restricted ourselves to simpler\nsituations of rigid bodies.  A rigid body generally means a\nhard solid object having a definite shape and size.  But in\nreality,  bodies can be stretched, compr\nessed and bent. Even\nthe  appr eciably  rigid  steel bar can be defor med when a\nsufficiently large external force is applied on it.  This means\nthat solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.\nA solid has  definite shape and size. In order to change (or\ndeform) the shape or size of a body, a for ce  is r equired. If\nyou stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the\nlength of the spring incr eases slightly. When you leave the\nends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  The\nproperty of a body, by virtue of  which  it tends to regain its\noriginal size and shape when the applied force is removed, is\nknown as elasticity and the defor mation caused is known\nas elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump\nof putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their\nprevious shape, and they get per manently deformed. Such\nsubstances ar e called plastic and this pr operty is called\nplasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.\nThe elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role\nin engineering design.  For example, while designing a\nbuilding, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel,\nconcrete etc. is essential.  The same is true in the design of\nbridges, automobiles, ropeways etc.  One could also ask  —\nCan we design an aer oplane which is very  light  but\nsufficiently  strong?  Can we design an artificial limb which\nis lighter but str onger?  Why does a railway track have a\nparticular shape  like I?  Why  is glass brittle while brass is\nnot?  Answers to such questions begin with the study of how\nrelatively  simple kinds of loads or for ces act to defor m\ndifferent solids bodies.

    "content": "8.2  STRESS AND STRAIN\nWhen  forces are applied on a body in such a\nmanner that the body is still in static equilibrium,\nit is deformed to a small or large extent depending\nupon the nature of the material of the body and\nthe magnitude of the deforming force.  The\ndeformation may not be noticeable visually in\nmany materials but it is there. When a body is\nsubjected to a deforming force, a restoring force\nis developed in the body. This restoring force is\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction to\nthe applied force. The restoring force per unit area\nis known as stress.  If F is the force applied normal\nto the cross–section and A  is the  area of cross\nsection of  the body,\nMagnitude of the stress = F/A (8.1)\nThe SI unit of stress is  N m –2 or pascal (Pa)\nand its dimensional formula is [ ML–1T–2 ].\nThere are three ways in which a solid may\nchange its dimensions when an exter nal force\nacts on it. These are shown in Fig. 8.1. In\nFig.8.1(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal\nforces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.\nThe restoring force per unit area  in this case is\ncalled tensile stress . If the cylinder is\ncompressed under the action of applied forces,\nthe restoring force per unit area is known as\ncompressive stress . Tensile or compressive\nstress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.\nIn both the cases, ther e is a change in the\nlength of the cylinder. The change in the length\n∆L to the original length L\nof the body (cylinder\nin this case) is known as longitudinal strain.\nLongitudinal strain\nΔ= L\nL (8.2)\nHowever, if two equal and opposite  deforming\nforces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional\narea of the cylinder , as shown in Fig. 8.1(b),\nther e is r elative displacement between the\nopposite faces of the cylinder.  The restoring force\nper unit ar ea developed due to the applied\ntangential force is known as tangential or\nshearing stress.\nAs a result of applied tangential force, there\nis a relative displacement ∆x between opposite\nfaces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 8.1(b).\nThe strain so pr oduced is known as shearing\nstrain and it is defined as the ratio of relative\ndisplacement of the faces ∆x  to the length of the\ncylinder\nL.\nShearing strain\nΔ= x\nL  = tan θ (8.3)\nwhere θ is the angular displacement of the\ncylinder from the vertical (original position of the\ncylinder). Usually\nθ is very small, tan θ\nis nearly equal to angle θ, (if θ = 10°, for\nexample, there is only 1% difference between θ\nand tan θ).\nIt can also be visualised, when a book is\npressed with the hand and pushed horizontally,\nas shown in Fig. 8.2 (c).\nThus, shearing strain  = tan θ ≈ θ (8.4)\nIn Fig. 8.1 (d), a solid sphere placed in the fluid\nunder high pressure is compressed uniformly on\nall sides.

    "content": "8.4  STRESS-STRAIN CURVE\nThe relation between the stress and the strain\nfor a given material under tensile stress can be\nfound experimentally. In a standar d test of\ntensile properties, a test cylinder or a wir e is\nstretched by an applied for ce. The fractional\nchange in length (the strain) and the applied\nfor\nce needed to cause the strain ar e recorded.\nThe applied force is gradually increased in steps\nand the change in length is noted. A graph is\nplotted between the str ess (which is equal in\nmagnitude to the applied force per unit area) and\nthe strain produced. A typical graph for a metal\nis shown in Fig. 8.2. Analogous graphs for\ncompression and shear stress may also be\nobtained. The stress-strain curves vary from\nmaterial to material. These curves help us to\nunderstand how a given material deforms with\nincreasing loads. Fr om the graph, we can see\nthat in the region between O to A, the curve is\nlinear.  In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed.\nThe body regains its original dimensions when\nthe applied force is removed. In this region, the\nsolid behaves as an elastic body.\nIn the region from A to B, str ess and strain\nare not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still\nreturns to its original dimension when the load\nis removed. The point B in the curve is known\nas yield point (also known as elastic limit) and\nthe corr esponding str ess is known as yield\nstrength (\nσy) of the material.\nIf the load is increased further , the str ess\ndeveloped exceeds the yield strength and strain\nincreases rapidly even for a small change in the\nstress. The portion of the curve between B and\nD shows this. When the load is removed, say at\nsome point C between B and D, the body does\nnot regain its original dimension. In this case,\neven when the str ess is zero, the strain is not\nzero. The material is said to have a permanent\nset. The defor mation is said to be plastic\ndeformation. The point D on the graph is the\nultimate tensile strength (\nσu) of the material.\nBeyond this point, additional strain is produced\neven by a r educed applied for ce and fractur e\noccurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and\nfracture points D and E are close, the material\nis said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the\nmaterial is said to be ductile.\nFig. 8.2 A typical stress-strain curve for a metal.\n170 PHYSICS\nAs stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour\nvaries from material to material. For example,\nrubber can be pulled to several times its original\nlength and still returns to its original shape. Fig.\n8.3 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic\ntissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that\nalthough elastic region is very large, the material\ndoes not obey Hooke’s law over most of the region.\nSecondly, there is no well defined plastic region.\nSubstances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc.\nwhich can be stretched to cause large strains\nare called elastomers.",

    "content": "8.6 APPLICATIONS OF ELASTIC\nBEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS\nThe elastic behaviour of materials plays an\nimportant role in everyday life. All engineering\ndesigns require precise knowledge of the elastic\nbehaviour of materials. For example while\ndesigning a building, the structural design of\nthe columns, beams and supports require\nknowledge of strength of materials used. Have\nyou ever thought why the beams used in\nconstruction of bridges, as supp orts etc. have\na cross-section of the type I? Why does a heap\nof sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape?\nAnswers to these questions can be obtained\nfrom the study of structural engineering which\nis based on concepts developed here.\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF SOLIDS 175\nCranes used for lifting and moving heavy loads\nfrom one place to another have a thick metal\nrope to which the load is attached. The rope is\npulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we\nwant to make a crane, which has a lifting\ncapacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric\nton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope\nbe? We obviously want that the load does not\ndeform the rope permanently. Therefore, the\nextension should not exceed the elastic limit.\nFrom Table 8.1, we find that mild steel has a\nyield strength (\nσy) of about 300 × 106 N m–2. Thus,\nthe area of cross-section (A) of the rope should\nat least be\nA ≥ W/σy  =  Mg/σy (8.15)\n=  (104 kg × 9.8 m s-2)/(300 × 106 N m-2)\n=  3.3 × 10-4 m2\ncorresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a\nrope of circular cross-section. Generally a\nlarge margin of safety (of about a factor of ten\nin the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of\nradius about 3 cm is recommended. A single\nwire of this radius would practically be a rigid\nrod. So the ropes are always made of a number\nof thin wires braided together , like in pigtails,\nfor ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength.\nA bridge has to be designed such that it can\nwithstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force\nof winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the\ndesign of buildings the use of beams and columns\nis very common. In both the cases, the\novercoming of the problem of bending of beam\nunder a load is of prime importance. The beam\nshould not bend too much or break. Let us\nconsider the case of a beam loaded at the centre\nand supported near its ends as shown in\nFig. 8.6.  A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth\nd when loaded at the centre by a load W sags by\nan amount given by\nδ = W l 3/(4bd 3Y) (8.16)\nThis relation can be derived using what you\nhave already learnt and a little calculus. From\nEq. (8.16), we see that to reduce the bending\nfor a given load, one should use a material with\na large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material,\nincreasing the depth d rather than the breadth\nb is more effective in reducing the bending, since\nδ  is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course\nthe length l of the span should be as small as\npossible). But on increasing the depth, unless\nthe load is exactly at the right place (difficult to\narrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the\ndeep bar  may bend as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). This\nis called buckling. To avoid this, a common\ncompromise is the cross-sectional shape shown\nin Fig. 8.7(c). This section provides a large load-\nbearing surface and enough depth to prevent\nbending. This shape reduces the weight of the\nbeam without sacrificing the strength and\nhence reduces the cost.\nFig. 8.6 A beam supported at the ends and loaded\nat the centre.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 8.7 Different cross-sectional shapes of a\nbeam. (a) Rectangular section of a bar;\n(b) A thin bar and how it can buckle;\n(c) Commonly used section for a load\nbearing bar.\nThe use of pillars or columns is also very\ncommon in buildings and bridges. A pillar with\nrounded ends as shown in Fig. 8.9(a) supports\nless load than that with a distributed shape at\nthe ends [Fig. 8.9(b)]. The precise design of a\nbridge or a building has to take into account\nthe conditions under which it will function, the\ncost and long period, reliability of usable\nmaterial, etc.\n176 PHYSICS",

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension.\nIn general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress\n(associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression),\n(b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress.\n2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials.\nThis is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of\nelasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus\nare used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces\nthat act on them.\nA class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law.\n3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form\nF/A  = Y∆L/L\nwhere  ∆L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the\napplied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied\n(perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A.\n4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so\nthat the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement\n∆L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is\ncalled shear\nand the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is\npossible only in solids.\nIn this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form\nF/A = G × ∆L/L\nwhere ∆L is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F,\nand G is the shear modulus.\n5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding\nfluid, the Hooke’s law takes the form\np = B (∆V/V),\nwhere p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, ∆V/V  (the\nvolume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that\npressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object.\n(a)                         (b)\nFig. 8.8 Pillars or columns: (a) a pillar with rounded\nends, (b) Pillar with distributed ends.\nThe answer to the question why the maximum\nheight of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can\nalso be provided by considering the elastic\nproperties of rocks. A mountain base is not under\nuniform compression and this provides some\nshearing stress to the rocks under which they\ncan flow. The stress due to all the material on\nthe top should be less than the critical shearing\nstress at which the rocks flow.\nAt the bottom of a mountain of height h, the\nforce per unit area due to the weight of the\nmountain is h\nρg where ρ is the density of the\nmaterial of the mountain and g is the acceleration\ndue to gravity. The material at the bottom\nexperiences this force in the vertical direction,\nand the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore,\nthis is not a case of pressure or bulk compression.\nThere is a shear component, approximately h\nρg\nitself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is\n30 × 10 7 N m -2. Equating this to hρg, with\nρ  = 3 × 103 kg m-3 gives\nhρg  = 30 × 107 N m-2 .\nh      =  30 × 107 N m-2/(3 × 103 kg m-3 × 10 m s-2)\n= 10 km\nwhich is more than the height of Mt.

In the case of a wire, suspended from celing and stretched under the action of a weight (F)\nsuspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is  equal and opposite to\nthe weight. However, the tension at any cross-section A of the wire is just F and not 2F.\nHence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A.\n2. Hooke’s law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve.\n3. The Young’s modulus and shear modulus ar e relevant only for solids since only solids\nhave lengths and shapes.\n4. Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases.  It refers to the change in volume\nwhen every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body\nremains unchanged.\n5. Metals have lar ger values of Y oung’s modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material\nwith large value of Young’s modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its\nlength.\n6. In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is\nmisnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered\nto be more elastic.\n7. In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions\nalso. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described\nby just one elastic constant.  For example, for a wire under longitudinal strain, the\nlateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change, which is described\nby another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio).\n8.

It is this pr operty that\ndistinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.\nFluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of\nair and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water\nis not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian\nbody constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring\nin living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus\nunderstanding the behaviour and pr operties of fluids is\nimportant.\nHow are fluids different from solids? What is common in\nliquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite\nshape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,\nwhereas a gas fills the entir e volume of its container . We\nhave learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids\ncan be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas\ndepends on the str ess or pr essure acting on it. When we\ntalk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume\nunder atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases\nand solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change\nin volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small.\nIn other wor ds solids and liquids have much lower\ncompressibility as compared to gases.\nShear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its\nvolume fixed. The key pr operty of fluids is that they of fer\nvery little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by\napplication of very small shear str ess. The shearing str ess\nof fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.",

    "content": "Exercises\nAdditional exercises\nAppendix\nchest a large, light but strong wooden plank is\nplaced first, is saved fr om this accident. Such\neveryday experiences convince us that both the\nforce and its coverage area are important. Smaller\nthe area on which the force acts, greater is the\nimpact. This impact is known as pressure.\nWhen an object is submer ged in a fluid at\nrest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This\nforce is always nor mal to the object’s sur face.\nThis is so because if there wer\ne a component of\nforce parallel to the surface, the object will also\nexert a for ce on the fluid parallel to it; as a\nconsequence of Newton’s thir d law. This for ce\nwill cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.\nSince the fluid is at r est, this cannot happen.\nHence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has\nto be perpendicular to the sur face in contact\nwith it. This is shown in Fig.9.1(a).\nThe normal force exerted by the fluid at a point\nmay be measured. An idealised form of one such\npressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.\n9.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with\na spring that is calibrated to measure the force\nacting on the piston. This device is placed at a\npoint inside the fluid. The inward force exerted\nby the fluid on the piston is balanced by the\noutward spring force and is thereby measured.\nIf F is the magnitude of this normal force on the\npiston of area A then the average pressure Pav\nis defined as the nor mal force acting per unit\narea.\nP F\nAav =              (9.1)\nIn principle, the piston area can be made\narbitrarily small. The pr essure is then defined\nin a limiting sense as\nP = lim\n∆A 0→\nΔ\nΔ\nF\nA\n(9.2)\nPressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the\nreader that it is the component of the for ce\nnormal to the area under consideration and not\nthe (vector) force that appears in the numerator\nin Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2). Its dimensions are\n[ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has\nbeen named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the\nFrench scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who\ncarried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.\nA common unit of pr essure is the atmospher e\n(atm), i.e. the pr essur e exerted by the\natmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 × 105 Pa).\nAnother quantity, that is indispensable in\ndescribing fluids, is the density\nρ. For a fluid of\nmass m occupying volume V,\nρ = m\nV (9.3)\nThe dimensions of density are [ML –3]. Its SI\nunit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A\nliquid is largely incompressible and its density\nis therefore, nearly constant at all pr essures.\nGases, on the other hand exhibit a lar ge\nvariation in densities with pressure.\nThe density of water at 4 oC (277 K) is\n1.0 × 10 3 kg m –3. The r elative density of a\nsubstance is the ratio of its density to the\ndensity of water at 4 oC. It is a dimensionless\npositive scalar quantity. For example the relative\ndensity of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is\n2.7 × 103 kg m–3\n.  The densities of some common\nfluids are displayed in Table 9.1.",

    "content": "9.2.1 Pascal’s Law\nThe French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that\nthe pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all\npoints if they are at the same height. This fact\nmay be demonstrated in a simple way.\nFig. 9.2 shows an element in the interior of a\nfluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the\nform of a right-angled prism. In principle, this\nprismatic element is very small so that every\npart of it can be consider ed at the same depth\nfrom the liquid surface and therefore, the effect\nof the gravity is the same at all these points.\nBut for clarity we have enlar ged this element.\nThe forces on this element are those exerted by\nthe rest of the fluid and they must be normal to\nthe surfaces of the element as discussed above.\nThus, the fluid exerts pressures Pa, Pb and Pc on\nthis element of area corresponding to the normal\nforces Fa, Fb and Fc as shown in Fig. 9.2 on the\nfaces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by Aa, Ab\nand Ac respectively. Then\nFb sinθ = Fc, Fb cosθ = Fa (by equilibrium)\nAb sinθ = Ac, Ab cosθ = Aa (by geometry)\nThus,\n;b c a\nb c a\nb c a\nF F F P P PA A A= = = = (9.4)\nHence, pressure exerted is same in all\ndirections in a fluid at rest. It again reminds us\nthat like other types of stress, pressure is not a\nvector quantity. No dir ection can be assigned\nto it.  The for ce against any ar ea within (or\nbounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is\nnormal to the area, regardless of the orientation\nof the area.\nNow consider a fluid element in the form of a\nhorizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar\nis in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted\nat its two ends  must be balanced or the\npressure at the two ends should be equal. This\nproves that for a liquid in equilibrium the\npressure is same at all points in a horizontal\nplane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in\ndifferent parts of the fluid, then there would be\na flow as the  fluid will have some net for ce\nacting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the\npressure in the fluid must be same everywhere\nin a horizontal plane.",

    "content": "9.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth\nConsider a fluid at r est in a container . In\nFig. 9.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2.\nThe pressures at points 1 and 2 ar e P1 and P2\nrespectively. Consider a cylindrical element of\nfluid having area of base A and height h. As the\nfluid is at r est the r esultant horizontal for ces\nshould be zero and the resultant vertical forces\nshould balance the weight of the element. The\nforces acting in the vertical direction are due to\nthe fluid pr essur e at the top ( P1A) acting\ndownward, at the bottom (P2A) acting upward.\nIf mg is weight of the fluid in the cylinder we\nhave\n(P2 − P1) A = mg (9.5)\nNow, if ρ is the mass density of the fluid, we\nhave the mass of fluid to be m = ρV= ρhA so\nthat\nP2 − P1=  ρgh (9.6)\nFig. 9.2 Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC-DEF is an\nelement of the interior of a fluid at r est.\nThis element is in the for m of a right-\nangled prism. The element is small so that\nthe effect of gravity can be ignored, but it\nhas been enlarged for the sake of clarity.\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF FLUIDS 183\n⊳\nFig.9.3 Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is\nillustrated through pressure on a vertical\ncylindrical column.\nPressure difference depends on the vertical\ndistance h between the points (1 and 2), mass\ndensity of the fluid ρ and acceleration due to\ngravity g. If the point 1 under discussion is\nshifted to the top of the  fluid (say, water), which\nis open to the atmosphere, P1 may be replaced\nby atmospheric pressure (Pa) and we replace P2\nby P. Then Eq. (9.6) gives\nP = Pa + ρgh (9.7)\nThus, the pr essure P, at depth below the\nsurface of a liquid open to the atmospher e is\ngreater than atmospheric pr essur e by an\namount ρgh. The excess of pr essure, P − Pa, at\ndepth h is called a gauge pressure at that point.\nThe area of the cylinder is not appearing in\nthe expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (9.7).\nThus, the height of the fluid column is important\nand not cross-sectional or base area or the shape\nof the container. The liquid pressure is the same\nat all points at the same horizontal level (same\ndepth).  The result is appreciated through the\nexample of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three\nvessels A, B and C  [Fig.9.4] of different shapes.\nThey are connected at the bottom by a horizontal\npipe. On filling with water, the level in the three\nvessels is the same, though they hold different\namounts of water. This is so because water at\nthe bottom has the same pressure below each\nsection of the vessel.\nFig 9.4 Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The\nthree vessels A, B and C contain different\namounts of liquids, all upto the same\nheight.",

At sea level, it is\n1.013 × 10 5 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist\nEvangelista Torricelli (160 8–1647) devised for\nthe first time a method for measuring\natmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed\nat one end and filled with mer cury is inverted\ninto a trough of mercury as shown in Fig.9.5 (a).\nThis device is known as ‘mercury barometer’.\nThe space above the mercury column in the tube\ncontains only mercury vapour whose pressure\nP is so small  that it may be neglected. Thus,\nthe pressure at Point A=0.

When a water tap is turned on slowly,\nthe water flow is smooth initially, but loses its\nsmoothness when the speed of the outflow is\nincreased. In studying the motion of fluids, we\nfocus our attention on what is happening to\nvarious fluid particles at a particular point in\nspace at a particular time. The flow of the fluid\nis said to be steady if at any given point, the\nvelocity of each passing fluid particle remains\nconstant in time. This does not mean that the\nvelocity at different points in space is same. The\nvelocity of a particular particle may change as it\nmoves from one point to another. That is, at some\nother point the particle may have a different\nvelocity, but every other particle which passes\nthe second point behaves exactly as the previous\nparticle that has just passed that point. Each\nparticle follows a smooth path, and the paths of\nthe particles do not cross each other.\nFig. 9.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical\ntrajectory of a fluid particle.\n(b) A region of streamline flow.\nThe path taken by a fluid particle under a\nsteady flow is a streamline. It is defined as a\ncurve whose tangent at any point is in the\ndirection of the fluid velocity at that point.\nConsider the path of a particle as shown in\nFig.9.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid\nparticle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF FLUIDS 187\npermanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the\nfluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for\nif they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go\neither one way or the other and the flow would\nnot be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of\nflow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely\nspaced streamlines ? If we intend to show\nstreamline of every flowing particle, we would\nend up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes\nperpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g.,\nat three points P, R and Q in Fig.9.7 (b). The plane\npieces are so chosen that their boundaries be\ndetermined by the same set of streamlines. This\nmeans that number of fluid particles crossing\nthe surfaces as indicated at P , R and Q is the\nsame. If area of cross-sections at these points\nare AP,AR and AQ and speeds of fluid particles\nare vP, vR and vQ, then mass of fluid ∆mP crossing\nat AP in a small interval of time ∆t is ρPAPvP ∆t.\nSimilarly mass of fluid ∆mR flowing or crossing\nat AR in a small interval of time ∆t is  ρRARvR ∆t\nand mass of fluid  ∆mQ is ρQAQvQ ∆t crossing at\nAQ. The mass of liquid flowing out equals the\nmass flowing in, holds in all cases. Therefore,\nρPAPvP∆t = ρRARvR∆t = ρQAQvQ∆t (9.9)\nFor flow of incompressible fluids\nρP = ρR = ρQ\nEquation (9.9) reduces to\nAPvP = ARvR = AQvQ (9.10)\nwhich is called the equation of continuity and\nit is a statement of conservation of mass in flow\nof incompressible fluids. In general\nAv = constant (9.11)\nAv gives the volume flux or flow rate and\nremains constant throughout the pipe of flow.\nThus, at narrower portions where the\nstreamlines are closely spaced, velocity\nincreases and its vice versa. From (Fig 9.7b) it\nis clear that AR  > AQ or   vR <  vQ, the fluid is\naccelerated while passing from R to Q. This is\nassociated with a change in pressure in fluid\nflow in horizontal pipes.\nSteady flow is achieved at low flow speeds.\nBeyond a limiting value, called critical speed,\nthis flow loses steadiness and becomes\nturbulent. One sees this when a fast flowing\nstream encounters rocks, small foamy\nwhirlpool-like regions called ‘white water\nrapids are formed.\nFigure 9.8 displays streamlines for some\ntypical flows. For example, Fig. 9.8(a) describes\na laminar flow where the velocities at different\npoints in the fluid may have different magnitudes\nbut their directions are parallel.

    "content": "9.4  BERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE\nFluid flow is a complex phenomenon. But we\ncan obtain some useful properties for steady\nor streamline flows using the conservation\nof energy.\nConsider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying\ncross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying\nheights as shown in Fig. 9.9. We now suppose\nthat an incompressible fluid is flowing through\nthe pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must\nchange as a consequence of equation of\ncontinuity. A force is required to produce this\nacceleration, which is caused by the fluid\nsurrounding it, the pressure must be different\nin different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a\ngeneral expression that relates the pressure\ndifference between two points in a pipe to both\nvelocity changes (kinetic energy change) and\nelevation (height) changes (potential energy\nchange). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli\ndeveloped this relationship in 1738.\nConsider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC)\nand 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying\nbetween B and D. In an infinitesimal time\ninterval ∆t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose\nv1 is the speed at B and v2 at D, then fluid initially\nat B has moved a distance v1∆t to C (v1∆t is small\nenough to assume constant cross-section along\nBC). In the same interval ∆t the fluid initially at\nD moves to E, a distance equal to v2∆t. Pressures\nP1 and P2 act as shown on the plane faces of\nareas A1 and A2 binding the two regions. The\nwork done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W1 =\nP1A1(v1∆t) = P1∆V. Since the same volume ∆V\npasses through both the regions (from the\nequation of continuity) the work done by the fluid\nat the other end (DE) is W2 = P2A2(v2∆t) = P2∆V or,\n188 PHYSICS\nthe work done on the fluid is  –P2∆V. So the total\nwork done on the fluid is\nW1 – W2 =  (P1− P2) ∆V\nPart of this work goes into changing the kinetic\nenergy of the fluid, and part goes into changing\nthe gravitational potential energy. If the density\nof the fluid is ρ and ∆m = ρA1v1∆t = ρ∆V is the\nmass passing through the pipe in time ∆t, then\nchange in gravitational potential energy is\n∆U = ρg∆V (h2 − h1)\nThe change in its kinetic energy is\n∆K =\n1\n2\nρ ∆V (v2\n2 − v1\n2)\nWe can employ the work – ener gy theorem\n(Chapter 6) to this volume of the fluid and\nthis yields\n(P1− P2) ∆V =\n1\n2\nρ ∆V (v2\n2 − v1\n2) + ρg∆V (h2 − h1)\nWe now divide each term by ∆V to obtain\n(P1− P2) =\n1\n2\nρ (v2\n2 − v1\n2) + ρg (h2 − h1)\nWe can rearrange the above terms to obtain\nP1 +\n1\n2\nρv1\n2 + ρgh1 = P2+\n1\n2\nρv2\n2 + ρgh2\n(9.12)\nThis is Bernoulli’s equation. Since 1 and 2\nrefer to any two locations along the pipeline, we\nmay write the expression in general as\nP +\n1\n2\nρv2 + ρgh = constant (9.13)\nIn words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be\nstated as follows: As we move along a streamline\nthe sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy\nper unit volume\nρv2\n2\n\n\n\n  and the potential energy\nper unit volume (ρgh) remains a constant.\nNote that in applying the energy conservation\nprinciple, there is an assumption that no energy\nis lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids\nflow, some energy does get lost due to internal\nfriction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid\nflow, the different layers of the fluid flow with\ndifferent velocities. These layers exert frictional\nforces on each other resulting in a loss of energy.\nThis property of the fluid is called viscosity and\nis discussed in more detail in a later section. The\nlost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into\nheat energy. Thus, Bernoulli’s equation ideally\napplies to fluids with zero viscosity or non-\nviscous fluids. Another restriction on application\nof Bernoulli theorem is that the fluids must be\nincompressible, as the elastic energy of the fluid\nis also not taken into consideration. In practice,\nit has a large number of useful applications and\ncan help explain a wide variety of phenomena\nfor low viscosity incompressible fluids.\nBernoulli’s equation also does not hold for non-\nsteady or turbulent flows, because in that\nsituation velocity and pressure are constantly\nfluctuating in time.\nWhen a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero\neverywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes\nP1 + ρgh1 = P2 + ρgh2\n(P1− P2) = ρg (h2 − h1)\nwhich is same as Eq. (9.6).",

    "content": "9.4.2 Dynamic Lift\nDynamic lift is the force that acts on a body,\nsuch as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning\nball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid.  In\nmany games such as cricket, tennis, baseball,\nor golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates\nfrom its parabolic trajectory as it moves through\nair. This deviation can be partly explained on\nthe basis of Bernoulli’s principle.\n(i) Ball moving without spin : Fig. 9.11(a)\nshows the streamlines around a\nnon-spinning ball moving relative to a\nfluid. From the symmetry of streamlines\nit is clear that the velocity of fluid (air)\nabove and below the ball at corresponding\npoints is the same resulting in zero\npressure difference. The air therefore,\nexerts no upward or downward force on\nthe ball.\n(ii) Ball moving with spin : A ball which is\nspinning drags air along with it. If the\nsurface is rough more air will be dragged.\nFig 9.11(b) shows  the streamlines of air\nfor a ball which is moving and spinning\nat the same time. The ball is moving\nforward and relative to it the air is moving\nbackwards. Therefore, the velocity of air\nabove the ball relative to the ball is larger\nand below it is smaller (see Section 9.3).\nThe stream lines, thus, get crowded above\nand rarified below.\nThis difference in the velocities of air results\nin the pressure difference between the lower and\nupper faces and there is a net upward force on\nthe ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called\nMagnus effect.\nAerofoil or lift on aircraft wing:  Figure 9.11\n(c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece\nshaped to provide an upward dynamic lift\nwhen it moves horizontally thr ough air . The\ncross-section of the wings of an aeroplane\nlooks somewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig.\n9.11 (c) with streamlines around it. When the\naerofoil moves against the wind, the\norientation of the wing relative to flow direction\ncauses the streamlines to crowd together\nabove the wing more than those below it. The\nflow speed on top is higher than that below it.\nThere is an upward force resulting in a\ndynamic lift of the wings and this balances\nthe weight of the plane.

This resistance to fluid motion\nis like an internal friction analogous to friction when\na solid moves on a surface. It is called  viscosity.\nThis force exists when there is relative motion\nbetween layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider\na fluid  like oil  enclosed between two glass plates\nas shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). The bottom plate is fixed\nwhile the top plate is moved with a constant\nvelocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is\nreplaced by honey, a greater force is required to\nmove the plate with the same velocity. Hence\nwe say that honey is more viscous than oil. The\nfluid in contact with a surface has the same\nvelocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer\nof the liquid in contact with top surface moves\nwith a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in\ncontact with the fixed surface is stationary. The\nvelocities of layers increase uniformly from\nbottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity\nv). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls\nit forward while lower layer pulls it backward.\nThis results in force between the layers.

The coefficient of\nviscosity (pronounced ‘eta’) for a fluid is defined\nas the ratio of shearing stress to the strain rate.\n(9.16)\nThe SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (Pl). Its\nother units are N s m-2 or Pa s. The dimensions\nof viscosity are [ML-1T-1]. Generally, thin liquids,\nlike water, alcohol, etc., ar e less viscous than\nthick liquids, like coal tar, blood, glycerine, etc.\nThe coefficients of viscosity for some common\nfluids are listed in Table 9.2. We point out two\nfacts about blood and water that you may find\ninteresting. As Table 9.2 indicates, blood is\n‘thicker’ (more viscous) than water. Further, the\nrelative viscosity ( η/ηwater) of blood remains\nconstant between 0\no\nC and 37\no\nC.\ntype of flow is known as laminar. The layers of\nliquid slide over one another as the pages of a\nbook do when it is placed flat on a table and a\nhorizontal force is applied to the top cover. When\na fluid is flowing in a pipe or a tube, then  velocity\nof the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is\nmaximum and  decreases  gradually as we move\ntowards the walls where it becomes zero,\nFig. 9.12 (b).

A relative\nmotion between the different layers of the fluid\nis set and, as a result, the body experiences a\nretarding force. Falling of a raindrop and\nswinging of a pendulum bob are some common\nexamples of such motion. It is seen that the\nviscous force is proportional to the velocity of\nthe object and is opposite to the direction of\nmotion. The other quantities on which the force\nF depends are viscosity η of the fluid and radius\na of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (181 9–\n1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly\nthe viscous drag force F as\n6F av η= π (9.17)\nThis is known as Stokes’ law. W e shall not\nderive Stokes’ law.\nThis law is an interesting example of retarding\nforce, which is proportional to velocity. We can\nstudy its consequences on an object falling\nthrough a viscous  medium. W e consider a\nraindrop in air . It accelerates initially due to\ngravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding\nforce also increases. Finally, when viscous force\nplus buoyant force becomes equal to  the force\ndue to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so\ndoes the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then\ndescends with a constant velocity. Thus , in\nequilibrium, this terminal velocity vt is given by\n6π\nηavt = (4π/3) a3 (ρ-σ)g\nwhere ρ and σ are mass densities of sphere and\nthe fluid, respectively. We obtain\nvt = 2a2 (ρ-σ)g / (9η) (9.18)\nSo the terminal velocity vt depends on the\nsquare of the radius of the sphere and inversely\non the viscosity of the medium.\nYou may like to refer back to Example 6.2 in\nthis context.",

The intermolecular distances are\nsuch that it is attracted to all the surrounding\nmolecules [Fig. 9.14(a)]. This attraction results\nin a negative potential energy for the molecule,\nwhich depends on the number and distribution\nof molecules around the chosen one. But the\naverage potential energy of all the molecules is\nthe same. This is supported by the fact that to\ntake a collection of such molecules (the liquid)\nand to disperse them far away from each other\nin order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of\nevaporation required is quite large. For water it\nis of the order of 40 kJ/mol.\n194 PHYSICS\nhorizontal liquid film ending in bar free to slide\nover parallel guides Fig (9.15).\nFig. 9.15 Stretching a film. (a) A film in equilibrium;\n(b) The film stretched an extra distance.\nSuppose that we move the bar by a small\ndistance d as shown. Since the area of the\nsurface increases, the system now has more\nenergy, this means that some work has been\ndone against an internal force. Let this internal\nforce be F, the work done by the applied force is\nF.d = Fd. From conservation of ener gy, this is\nstored as additional energy in the film. If the\nsurface energy of the film is S per unit area, the\nextra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the\nliquid in between, so there are two surfaces and\nthe extra energy is\nS (2dl) = Fd (9.19)\nOr, S=Fd/2dl = F/2l (9.20)\nThis quantity S is the magnitude of surface\ntension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit\narea of the liquid interface and is also equal to\nthe force per unit length exerted by the fluid on\nthe movable bar.\nSo far we have talked about the surface of\none liquid. More generally, we need to consider\nfluid surface in contact with other fluids or solid\nsurfaces. The surface energy in that case\ndepends on the materials on both sides of the\nsurface. For example, if the molecules of the\nmaterials attract each other, surface energy is\nreduced while if they repel each other the\nsurface energy is increased. Thus, more\nappropriately, the surface energy is the energy\nof the interface between two materials and\ndepends on both of them.\nWe make the following observations from\nabove:\n(i) Surface tension is a force per unit length\n(or surface energy per unit area) acting in\nthe plane of the interface between the plane\nof the liquid and any other substance; it also\nis the extra energy that the molecules at the\ninterface have as compared to molecules in\nthe interior.\n(ii) At any point on the interface besides the\nboundary, we can draw a line and imagine\nequal and opposite surface tension forces\nS per unit length of the line acting\nperpendicular to the line, in the plane of\nthe interface. The line is in equilibrium. To\nbe more specific, imagine a line of atoms or\nmolecules at the surface. The atoms to the\nleft pull the line towards them; those to the\nright pull it towards them! This line of\natoms is in equilibrium under tension. If\nthe line really marks the end of the\ninterface, as in Figure 9.14 (a) and (b) there\nis only the force S per unit length\nacting inwards.",

    "content": "9.6.3 Angle of Contact\nThe surface of liquid near the plane of contact,\nwith another medium is in general curved. The\nangle between tangent to the liquid surface at\nthe point of contact and solid surface inside the\nliquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted\nby\nθ. It is different at interfaces of different pairs\nof liquids and solids. The value of θ determines\nwhether a liquid will spread on the surface of a\nsolid or it will form droplets on it. For example,\nwater forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in\nFig. 9.17 (a) while spreads over a clean plastic\nplate as shown in Fig. 9.17(b).\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 9.17 Different shapes of water drops with\ninterfacial tensions (a) on a lotus leaf (b)\non a clean plastic plate.\nWe consider the three interfacial tensions at\nall the three interfaces, liquid-air, solid-air and\nsolid-liquid denoted by Sla, Ssa and Ssl , respectively\nas given in Fig. 9.17 (a) and (b). A t the line of\ncontact, the surface forces between the three media\nmust be in equilibrium. From the Fig. 9.17(b) the\nfollowing relation is easily derived.\nSla cos θ  +  Ssl =  Ssa (9.22)\nThe angle of contact is an obtuse angle if\nSsl  > Sla as in the case of water -leaf inter face\nwhile it is an acute angle if Ssl  < Sla as in the\ncase of water -plastic inter face. When θ is an\nobtuse angle then molecules of liquids are\nattracted strongly to themselves and weakly to\nthose of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a\nliquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not\nwet the solid. This is what happens with water\non a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on\n196 PHYSICS\nany surface. On the other hand, if the molecules\nof the liquid are strongly attracted to those of\nthe solid, this will reduce Ssl and therefore,\ncos θ may increase or θ may decrease. In this\ncase θ is an acute angle. This is what happens\nfor water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene\noil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps,\ndetergents and dying substances are wetting\nagents. When they are added the angle of\ncontact becomes small so that these may\npenetrate well and become ef fective. W ater\nproofing agents on the other hand are added to\ncreate a large angle of contact between the water\nand fibres.",

You must have seen\nthis especially clearly in small drops just formed\nin a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles\nblown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops\nand bubbles spherical? What keeps soap\nbubbles stable?\nAs we have been saying repeatedly, a liquid-\nair interface has energy, so for a given volume\nthe surface with minimum energy is the one with\nthe least area. The sphere has this property.\nThough it is out of the scope of this book, but\nyou can check that a sphere is better than at\nleast a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and\nother forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective,\nliquid drops would be spherical.\nAnother interesting consequence of surface\ntension is that the pressure inside a spherical\ndrop Fig. 9.18(a) is more than the pressure\noutside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is\nin equilibrium. If its radius increase by ∆r. The\nextra surface energy is\n[4π(r + ∆r) 2- 4πr2] Sla = 8πr ∆r Sla (9.23)\nIf the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is\nbalanced by the energy gain due to\nexpansion under the pressure difference (Pi – Po)\nbetween the inside of the bubble and the outside.\nThe work done is\nW = (Pi – Po) 4πr2∆r (9.24)\nso that\n(Pi – Po) = (2 Sla/ r) (9.25)\nIn general, for a liquid-gas interface, the\nconvex side has a higher pressure than the\nconcave side. For example, an air bubble in a\nliquid, would have higher pressure inside it.\nSee Fig 9.18 (b).\nFig. 9.18 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r.\nA bubble Fig 9.18 (c) differs from a drop\nand a cavity; in this it has two interfaces. Applying\nthe above argument we have for a bubble\n(Pi – Po) = (4 Sla/ r) (9.26)\nThis is probably why you have to blow hard,\nbut not too hard, to form a soap bubble.

The word capilla means\nhair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise\nwould be very large. To see this, consider a\nvertical capillary tube of circular cross section\n(radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water\n(Fig. 9.19). The contact angle between water and\nFig. 9.19 Capillary rise, (a) Schematic picture of a\nnarrow tube immersed water.\n(b) Enlarged picture near interface.\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF FLUIDS 197\n⊳glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in the\ncapillary is concave. This means that there is\na pressure difference between the two sides\nof the top surface. This is given by\n(Pi – Po) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )\n= (2S/a) cos θ (9.27)\nThus the pressure of the water inside the\ntube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)\nis less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider\nthe two points A and B in Fig. 9.19(a). They\nmust be at the same pressure, namely\nP0 + h\nρ g = Pi = PA (9.28)\nwhere ρ ρρ ρρ is the density of water and h is called\nthe capillary rise  [Fig. 9.19(a)]. Using\nEq. (9.27) and (9.28) we have\nh ρ g = (Pi – P0) = (2S cos θ )/a    (9.29)\nThe discussion here, and the Eqs. (9.24) and\n(9.25) make it clear that the capillary rise is due\nto surface tension. It is lar ger, for a smaller a.\nTypically it is of the order of a few cm for fine\ncapillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using\nthe value of surface tension for water (Table 9.3),\nwe find that\nh = 2S/(\nρ g a)\n-1\n3 -3 -2 -4\n2 ×(0.073 N m )= (10 kg m ) (9.8 m s )(5 × 10 m)\n= 2.98 × 10–2 m = 2.98 cm\nNotice that if the liquid meniscus is convex,\nas for mercury, i.e., if cos θ is negative then from\nEq.

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any\nresistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the\nshape of its container .\n2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible\nand it expands to occupy all the space available to it.\n3. If F is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area A then the average pressure Pav\nis defined as the ratio of the force to area\nA\nFPav =\n198 PHYSICS\n4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m -2. Other common\nunits of pressure are\n1 atm = 1.01×105 Pa\n1 bar = 105 Pa\n1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa\n1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa\n5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at\nthe same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted\nundiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.\n6. The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression\nP = Pa + ρgh\nwhere  ρ is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.\n7. The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of\nnon uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow.\nv A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)\nThe equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.\n8. Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the\npressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume ( ρv2/2) and the potential energy per\nunit volume ( ρgy) remains a constant.\nP + ρv2/2 + ρgy = constant\nThe equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss fluid\nmotion in steady state. There is no fluid which have zero viscosity, so the above\nstatement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the\nkinetic energy to heat energy.\n9. Though shear strain in a fluid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is\napplied to a fluid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing\nwith time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known\nas coefficient of viscosity, η.\nwhere symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text.\n10. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with\nvelocity v through a fluid of viscosity is, F = 6π\nηav.\n11. Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in\nthe plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra\nenergy that the molecules at the inter face have as compar ed to the interior.",

    "content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. Pressure is a scalar quantity . The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area”\nmay give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force” in the numerator of\nthe definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is\nimpressed. While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body\nmechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point\nin the fluid.\n2.  One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the\nwalls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at\nall points in a fluid. An element of a fluid (such as the one shown in Fig. 9.4) is in\nequilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal.\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF FLUIDS 199\n3. The expression for pressure\nP = Pa + ρgh\nholds true if fluid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids, which\nare largely incompressible and hence  is a constant with height.\n4. The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure.\nP – Pa = Pg\nMany pressure-measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre\npressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer).\n5. A streamline is a map of fluid flow. In a steady flow two streamlines do not intersect as\nit means that the fluid particle will have two possible velocities at the point.\n6. Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the fluid. The work\ndone by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case, and P2\n[Fig. 9.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (9.12).\n7. As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient\nof viscosity, η  falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of\natoms and η  increases.\n8. Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface\nin comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present\nat the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a fluid. It is not the\nproperty of a single fluid alone.",

Many physical pr operties of\nmaterials change sufficiently with temperature.\nSome such properties are used as the basis for\nconstructing thermometers. The commonly used\nproperty is variation of the volume of a liquid\nwith temperature. For example, in common\nliquid–in–glass thermometers,  mercury, alcohol\netc., are used whose volume varies linearly with\ntemperature over a wide range.\nThermometers are calibrated so that a\nnumerical value may be assigned to a given\ntemperature in an appropr iate scale. For the\ndefinition of any standard scale, two fixed\nreference points are needed. Since all\nsubstances change dimensions with\ntemperature, an absolute reference for\nexpansion is not available. However , the\nnecessary fixed points may be correlated to the\nphysical phenomena that always occur at the\nsame temperature. The ice point and the steam\npoint of water are two convenient fixed points\nand are known as the freezing and boiling\npoints, respectively. These two points are the\ntemperatures at which pure water freezes and\nboils under standard pressure. The two familiar\ntemperature scales are the Fahrenheit\ntemperature scale and the Celsius temperature\nscale. The ice and steam point have values\n32 °F and 212 °F, respectively, on the Fahrenheit\nscale and 0 °C and 100 °C on the Celsius scale.\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal\nintervals between two reference points, and on\nthe Celsius scale, there are 100.\nFig. 10.1 A plot of Fahrenheit temperature (tF) versus\nCelsius temperature (tc).\nA relationship for converting between the two\nscales may be obtained fr om a graph of\nFahrenheit temperatur e ( tF) versus celsius\ntemperature (t C) in a straight line (Fig. 10.1),\nwhose equation is\nt tF C– 32\n180 100= (10.1)",

Notice that since PV = constant\nand V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas,\nthen PV/T should also be a constant. This\nrelationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be\nwritten in a more general form that applies not\njust to a given quantity of a single gas but to any\nquantity of any low-density gas and is known as\nideal-gas equation:\nor PV = µRT (10.2)\nwhere, µ is the number of moles in the sample of\ngas and R is called universal gas constant:\nR = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1\nIn Eq. 10.2, we have learnt that the pressure\nand volume ar e dir ectly pr oportional to\ntemperature : PV ∝ T. This relationship allows a\ngas to be used to measur e temperatur e in a\nconstant volume gas thermometer. Holding the\nvolume of a gas constant, it gives P ∝T. Thus,\nwith a constant-volume gas ther mometer ,\ntemperature is read in terms of pressure. A plot\nof pressure versus temperature gives a straight\nline in this case, as shown in Fig. 10.2.\nHowever, measurements on real gases deviate\nfrom the values predicted by the ideal gas law\nat low temperature.

Similarly,\nin case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a\ncool room may expand to full size when placed\nin war m water . On the other hand, a fully\ninflated balloon when immersed in cold water\nwould start shrinking due to contraction of the\nair inside.\nIt is our common experience that most\nsubstances expand on heating and contract on\ncooling. A change in the temperature of a body\ncauses change in its dimensions. The increase\nin the dimensions of a body due to the increase\nin its temperature is called thermal expansion.\nThe expansion in length is called linear\nexpansion.

The\nvolume of a given amount of water decreases as\nit is cooled from room temperature, until its\ntemperature reaches 4 °C, [Fig. 10.7(a)]. Below\n4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore, the\ndensity decreases [Fig. 10.7(b)].\nThis means that water has the maximum\ndensity at 4 °C. This property has an important\nenvironmental effect: bodies of water , such as\nlakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake\ncools toward 4\n°C, water near the surface loses\nenergy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and\nsinks; the war mer, less dense water near the\nbottom rises. However, once the colder water on\ntop reaches temperature below 4 °C, it becomes\nless dense and remains at the surface, where it\nfreezes. If water did not have this property, lakes\nand ponds would freeze from the bottom up,\nwhich would destroy much of their animal and\nplant life.\nGases, at ordinary temperature, expand more\nthan solids and liquids. For liquids, the\ncoefficient of volume expansion is r elatively\nindependent of the temperatur e. However, for\ngases it is dependent on temperatur e. For an\nideal gas, the coefficient of volume expansion at\nconstant pressure can be found from the ideal\ngas equation:\nPV =\nµRT\nAt constant pressure\nP∆V = µR ∆T\n∆ ∆V\nV\nT\nT=\ni.e., αv\nT= 1  for ideal gas (10.6)\nAt 0  °C, αv = 3.7  × 10–3 K –1, which is much\nlarger than that for solids and liquids.\nEquation (10.6) shows the temp erature\ndependence of\nαv; it decreases with increasing\ntemperature. For a gas at room temperature and\nconstant pressure,\nαv is about 3300 × 10–6 K–1, as\nTemperature (°C) Temperature (°C)\n(a) (b)\nFig. 10.7 Thermal expansion of water.\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 207\n⊳\n⊳\nmuch as order(s) of magnitude larger than the\ncoefficient of volume expansion of typical liquids.\nThere is a simple relation between the\ncoef ficient of volume expansion ( αv) and\ncoefficient of linear expansion ( αl). Imagine a\ncube of length, l, that expands equally in all\ndirections, when its temperatur e increases by\n∆T. We have\n∆l = αl l ∆T\nso, ∆V = (l+∆l)3 – l3 ≃  3l2 ∆l (10.7)\nIn Equation (10.7), terms in (∆l)2 and (∆l)3 have\nbeen neglected since ∆l is small compared to l.\nSo\n∆ ∆ ∆V V l\nl V Tl= =3 3 α (10.8)\nwhich gives\nαv = 3αl (10.9)\nWhat happens by preventing the thermal\nexpansion of a r od by fixing its ends rigidly?\nClearly, the rod acquires a compr essive strain\ndue to the external forces provided by the rigid\nsupport at the ends. The corr esponding stress\nset up in the rod is called thermal stress.

    "content": "10.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY\nTake some water in a vessel and start heating it\non a burner. Soon you will notice that bubbles\nbegin to move upward. As the temperature is\nraised the motion of water particles increases\ntill it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling.\nWhat are the factors on which the quantity of\nheat required to raise the temperature of a\nsubstance depend? In order to answer this\nquestion in the first step, heat a given quantity\nof water to raise its temperature by, say 20 °C\nand note the time taken. Again take the same\namount of water and raise its temperature by\n40 °C using the same source of heat. Note the\ntime taken by using a stopwatch. You will find it\ntakes about twice the time and therefore, double\nthe quantity of heat required raising twice the\ntemperature of same amount of water.\nIn the second step, now suppose you take\ndouble the amount of water and heat it, using\nthe same heating arrangement, to raise the\ntemperature by 20 °C, you will find the time taken\nis again twice that required in the first step.\nIn the third step, in place of water, now heat\nthe same quantity of some oil, say mustard oil,\nand raise the temperature again by 20 °C. Now\nnote the time by the same stopwatch. Y ou will\nfind the time taken will be shorter and therefore,\nthe quantity of heat required would be less than\nthat required by the same amount of water for\nthe same rise in temperature.\nThe above observations show that the quantity\nof heat r equired to war m a given substance\ndepends on its mass, m, the change in\ntemperature, ∆T and the natur e of substance.\nThe change in temperature of a substance, when\na given quantity of heat is absorbed or rejected\nby it, is characterised by a quantity called the\nheat capacity of that substance. We define heat\ncapacity, S of a substance as\nQS T\n∆= ∆ (10.10)\nwhere ∆Q is the amount of heat supplied to\nthe substance to change its temperature from T\nto T + ∆T.\nYou have observed that if equal amount of\nheat is added to equal masses of dif ferent\nsubstances, the resulting temperature changes\nwill not be the same. It implies that every\nsubstance has a unique value for the amount of\nheat absorbed or given off to change the\ntemperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This\nquantity is referred to as the specific heat\ncapacity of the substance.\nIf ∆Q stands for the amount of heat absorbed\nor given off by a substance of mass m when it\nundergoes a temperature change ∆T, then the\nspecific heat capacity, of that substance is given\nby\n1S Qs m m T\n∆= = ∆ (10.11)\nThe specific heat capacity is the property of\nthe substance which determines the change in\nthe temperature of the substance (undergoing\nno phase change) when a given quantity of heat\nis absorbed (or given off) by it. It is defined as the\namount of heat per unit mass absorbed or given\noff by the substance to change its temperature\nby one unit. It depends on the nature of the\nsubstance and its temperature. The SI unit of\nspecific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.\nIf the amount of substance is specified in\nterms of moles\nµ, instead of mass m in kg, we\ncan define heat capacity per mole of the\nsubstance by\n(10.12)\nwhere C is known as molar specific heat\ncapacity  of the substance. Like S, C also\ndepends on the nature of the substance and its\ntemperature. The SI unit of molar specific heat\ncapacity is J mol–1 K–1.\nHowever, in connection with specific heat\ncapacity of gases, additional conditions may be\nneeded to define C. In this case, heat transfer\ncan be achieved by keeping either pr essure or\nvolume constant. If the gas is held under\nconstant pressure during the heat transfer, then\nit is called the molar specific heat capacity at\nconstant pressure and is denoted by Cp. On\nthe other hand, if the volume of the gas is\nmaintained during the heat transfer , then the\ncorresponding molar specific heat capacity is\ncalled molar specific heat capacity at constant\nvolume and is denoted by Cv.

    "content": "10.8  CHANGE OF STATE\nMatter normally exists in three states: solid,\nliquid and gas. A transition from one of these\nstates to another is called a change of state. Two\ncommon changes of states ar e solid to liquid\nand liquid to gas (and, vice versa). These changes\ncan occur when the exchange of heat takes place\nbetween the substance and its surr oundings.\nTo study the change of state on heating or\ncooling, let us perform the following activity.\nTake some cubes of ice in a beaker. Note the\ntemperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a\nconstant heat source. Note the temperature after\nevery  minute.  Continuously stir the mixture of\nwater and ice. Draw a graph between\ntemperature and time (Fig. 10.9). You will observe\nno change in the temperature as long as there\nis ice in the beaker . In the above pr ocess, the\ntemperature of the system does not change even\nthough heat is being continuously supplied. The\nheat supplied  is being utilised in changing the\nstate from solid (ice) to liquid (water).\nFig. 10.9 A plot of temperature versus time showing\nthe changes in the state of ice on heating\n(not to scale).\nThe change of state from solid to liquid is called\nmelting or fusion and from liquid to solid is called\nfreezing. It is observed that the temperature\nremains constant until the entire amount of the\nsolid substance melts. That is, both the solid and\nthe liquid states of the substance coexist in\nthermal equilibrium during the change of\nstates from solid to liquid. The temperature at\nwhich the solid and the liquid states of the\nsubstance is in thermal equilibrium with each\nother is called its melting point . It is\ncharacteristic of the substance. It also depends\non pressure. The melting point of a substance\nat standard atomspheric pressure is called its\nnormal melting point. Let us do the following\nactivity to understand the process of melting\nof ice.\nTake a slab of ice. T ake a metallic wir e and\nfix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends. Put\nthe wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 10.10.\nYou will observe that the wir e passes thr ough\nthe ice slab. This happens due to the fact that\njust below the wir e, ice melts at lower\ntemperature due to increase in pressure. When\nthe wire has passed, water above the wire freezes\nagain. Thus, the wire passes through the slab\nand the slab does not split. This phenomenon\nof r efreezing is called regelation. Skating is\npossible on snow due to the formation of water\nunder the skates. W ater is for med due to the\nincrease of pressure and it acts as a\nlubricant.\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 211\nFig. 10.10\nAfter the whole of ice gets converted into water\nand as we continue further heating, we shall see\nthat temperature begins to rise (Fig.10.9). The\ntemperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly\n100 °C when it again becomes steady. The heat\nsupplied is now being utilised to change water\nfrom liquid state to vapour or  gaseous state.\nThe change of state from liquid to vapour (or\ngas) is called vaporisation. It is observed that\nthe temperatur e r emains constant until the\nentire amount of the liquid is converted into\nvapour. That is, both the liquid and vapour states\nof the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium,\nduring the change of state from liquid to vapour.\nThe temperature at which the liquid and the\nvapour states of the substance coexist is called\nits boiling point. Let us do the following activity\nto understand the process of boiling of water.\nTake a r ound-bottom flask, mor e than half\nfilled with water. Keep it over a burner and fix a\nTriple Point\nThe temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state (phase change).\nA graph between the temperatur e T and the Pr essure P of the substance is called a phase\ndiagram or P – T diagram. The following figur e shows the phase diagram of water and CO 2.\nSuch a phase diagram divides the P – T plane into a solid-region, the vapour-region and the\nliquid-region. The regions are separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion\ncurve (AO) and vaporisation curve (CO). The points on sublimation curve represent states\nin which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO r epresent\nstates in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO represent\nstates in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO represent\nstates in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperature and pressure at which\nthe fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the thr ee\nphases of  a substance coexist is called the triple point of the substance. For example the\ntriple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.11×10–3 Pa.\n(a) (b)\nFigure :  Pressure-temperature phase diagrams for (a) water and (b) CO 2 (not to the scale).\n212 PHYSICS\nthermometer and steam outlet through the cork\nof the flask (Fig. 10.11). As water gets heated in\nthe flask, note first that the air , which was\ndissolved in the water , will come out as small\nbubbles. Later, bubbles of steam will for m at\nthe bottom but as they rise to the cooler water\nnear the top, they condense and disappear .\nFinally, as the temperatur e of the entir e mass\nof the water reaches 100  °C, bubbles of steam\nreach the surface and boiling is said to occur .\nThe steam in the flask may not be visible but as\nit comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny\ndroplets of water, giving a foggy appearance.\nFig. 10.11 Boiling process.\nIf now the steam outlet is closed for a few\nseconds to incr ease the pr essure in the flask,\nyou will notice that boiling stops. Mor e heat\nwould be r equired to raise the temperatur e\n(depending on the increase in pressure) before\nboiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases\nwith increase in pressure.\nLet us now remove the burner. Allow water to\ncool to about 80 °C. Remove the thermometer and\nsteam outlet. Close the flask with the airtight\ncork. Keep the flask turned upside down on the\nstand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. W ater\nvapours in the flask condense r educing the\npressure on the water surface inside the flask.\nWater begins to boil again, now at a lower\ntemperature. Thus boiling point decreases with\ndecrease in pressure.\nThis explains why cooking is difficult on hills.\nAt high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower,\nreducing the boiling point of water as compared\nto that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling\npoint is increased inside a pr essure cooker by\nincreasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster.\nThe boiling point of a substance at standar d\natmospheric pr essur e is called its normal\nboiling point.\nHowever, all substances do not pass through\nthe thr ee states: solid-liquid-gas. Ther e ar e\ncertain substances which nor mally pass fr om\nthe solid to the vapour state dir ectly and vice\nversa. The change fr om solid state to vapour\nstate without passing thr ough the liquid state\nis called sublimation, and the substance is said\nto sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also\niodine. During the sublimation process both the\nsolid and vapour states of a substance coexist\nin thermal equilibrium.",

The amount of heat\nper unit mass transferred during change of state\nof the substance is called latent heat of the\nsubstance for the process. For example, if heat\nis added to a given quantity of ice at –10 °C, the\ntemperature of ice increases until it reaches its\nmelting point (0  °C). At this temperature, the\naddition of mor e heat does not incr ease the\ntemperatur e but causes the ice to melt, or\nchanges its state. Once the entir e ice melts,\nadding more heat will cause the temperature of\nthe water to rise. A similar situation\noccurs during liquid gas change of state at the\nboiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water\ncauses vaporisation, without increase in\ntemperature.\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 213\n⊳\nThe heat required during a change of state\ndepends upon the heat of transformation and\nthe mass of the substance undergoing a change\nof state. Thus, if mass m of a substance\nundergoes a change from one state to the other,\nthen the quantity of heat required is given by\nQ = m L\nor L = Q/m (10.13)\nwhere L is known as latent heat and is a\ncharacteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is\nJ kg –1. The value of L also depends on the\npressure. Its value is usually quoted at standard\natmospheric pressure. The latent heat for a solid-\nliquid state change is called the latent heat of\nfusion (Lf), and that for a liquid-gas state change\nis called the latent heat of vaporisation  (Lv).\nThese are often referred to as the heat of fusion\nand the heat of vaporisation. A plot of\ntemperature versus heat  for a quantity of water\nis shown in Fig. 10.12. The latent heats of some\nsubstances, their freezing and boiling points, are\ngiven in Table 10.5.\nFig. 10.12 Temperature versus heat for water at\n1 atm pressure (not to scale).\nNote that when heat is added (or removed)\nduring a change of state, the temperature\nremains constant. Note in Fig. 10.12 that the\nslopes of the phase lines ar e not all the same,\nwhich indicate that specific heats of the various\nstates are not equal. For water, the latent heat of\nfusion and vaporisation are Lf = 3.33 × 105 J kg–1\nand Lv = 22.6 × 105 J kg–1, respectively. That is,\n3.33 × 105 J of heat is needed to melt 1 kg ice at\n0 °C, and 22.6 × 105 J of heat is needed to convert\n1 kg  water into steam at 100  °C. So, steam at\n100 °C carries  22.6 × 105 J  kg–1 more heat than\nwater at 100 °C. This is why burns from steam\nare usually more serious than those from\nboiling water.",

    "content": "10.9.1  Conduction\nConduction is the mechanism of transfer of heat\nbetween two adjacent parts of a body because\nof their temperature difference. Suppose, one end\nof a metallic rod is put in a flame, the other end\nof the rod will soon be so hot that you cannot\nhold it by your bare hands. Here, heat transfer\ntakes place by conduction fr om the hot end of\nthe rod through its different parts to the other\nend.  Gases are poor thermal conductors, while\nliquids have conductivities intermediate between\nsolids and gases.\nHeat conduction may be described\nquantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a\nmaterial for a given temperatur e dif ference.\nConsider a metallic bar of length L and uniform\ncross-section A with its two ends maintained at\ndifferent temperatures. This can be done, for\nexample, by putting the ends in thermal contact\nwith large reservoirs at temperatures, say, TC and\nTD, respectively (Fig. 10.14). Let us assume the\nideal condition that the sides of the bar are fully\ninsulated so that no heat is exchanged between\nthe sides and the surroundings.\nAfter sometime, a steady state is reached; the\ntemperature of the bar decreases uniformly with\ndistance from TC to TD; (TC>TD). The reservoir at\nC supplies heat at a constant rate, which\ntransfers through the bar and is given out at\nthe same rate to the reservoir at D. It is found\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 215\n⊳\nexperimentally that in this steady state, the rate\nof flow of heat (or heat current) H is proportional\nto the temperature difference ( TC – TD) and the\narea of cross-section A and is inversely\nproportional to the length L :\nH = KA –C DT T\nL (10.14)\nThe constant of proportionality K is called the\nthermal conductivity  of the material. The\ngreater the value of K for a material, the mor e\nrapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of K\nis\nJ s –1 m–1 K–1 or W m –1 K–1. The thermal\nconductivities of various substances ar e listed\nin Table 10.6. These values vary slightly with\ntemperatur e, but can be consider ed to be\nconstant over a normal temperature range.\nCompar e the r elatively lar ge ther mal\nconductivities of  good thermal conductors and,\nmetals, with the relatively small thermal\nconductivities of some good thermal insulators,\nsuch as wood and glass wool. Y ou may have\nnoticed that some cooking pots have copper\ncoating on the bottom. Being a good conductor\nof heat, copper promotes the distribution of heat\nover the bottom of a pot for unifor m cooking.\nPlastic foams, on the other hand, ar e good\ninsulators, mainly because they contain pockets\nof air. Recall that gases ar e poor conductors,\nand note the low thermal conductivity of air in\nthe Table 10.5. Heat retention and transfer are\nimportant in many other applications. Houses\nmade of concr ete r oofs get very hot during\nsummer days because thermal conductivity of\nconcrete (though much smaller than that of a\nmetal) is still not small enough. Therefore, people,\nusually, prefer to give a layer of earth or foam\ninsulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer is\nprohibited and keeps the room cooler. In some\nsituations, heat transfer is critical. In a nuclear\nreactor, for example, elaborate heat transfer\nsystems need to be installed so that the\nenormous energy produced by nuclear fission\nin the core transits out suf ficiently fast, thus\npreventing the core from overheating.",

    "content": "10.9.2  Convection\nConvection is a mode of heat transfer by actual\nmotion of matter. It is  possible only in fluids.\nConvection can be natural or forced. In natural\nconvection, gravity plays an important part.\nWhen a fluid is heated from below, the hot part\nexpands and, ther efore, becomes less dense.\nBecause of buoyancy, it rises and the upper\ncolder part replaces it. This again gets heated,\nrises up and is replaced by the relatively colder\npart of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode\nof heat transfer is evidently different from\nconduction. Convection involves bulk transport\nof different parts of the fluid.\nIn forced convection, material is forced to move\nby a pump or by some other physical means. The\ncommon  examples of forced convection systems\nare forced-air heating systems in home, the\nhuman circulatory system, and the cooling\nsystem of an automobile engine. In the human\nbody, the heart acts as the pump that circulates\nblood through different parts of the body,\ntransferring heat by forced convection and\nmaintaining it at a uniform temperature.\nNatural convection is responsible for many\nfamiliar phenomena. During the day, the\nground heats up more quickly than large bodies\nof water do. This occurs both because water has\na greater specific heat capacity and because\nmixing currents disperse the absorbed heat\nthroughout the great volume of water. The air\nin contact with the warm ground is heated by\nconduction. It expands, becoming less dense\nthan the surrounding cooler air. As a result, the\nwarm air rises (air currents) and the other air\nmoves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea\nbreeze near a lar ge body of water . Cooler air\ndescends, and a thermal convection cycle is set\nup, which transfers heat away from the land.\nAt night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,\nand the water surface is warmer than the land.\nAs a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 10.17).\nThe other example of natural convection is\nthe steady sur face wind on the earth blowing\nin fr om north-east towar ds the equator , the\nso-called trade wind. A resonable explanation\nis as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of\nthe earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the\nearth’s surface near the equator is hot, while\nthe air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is\ncool. In the absence of any other factor , a\nconvection curr ent would be set up, with the\nair at the equatorial surface rising and moving\nout towar ds the poles, descending and\nstreaming in towards the equator. The rotation\nof the earth, however, modifies this convection\ncurrent. Because of this, air close to the equator\nhas an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it\nis zero close to the poles. As a r esult, the air\ndescends not at the poles but at 30 ° N (North)\nlatitude and r eturns to the equator . This is\ncalled trade wind.\nFig. 10.17 Convection cycles.\n218 PHYSICS",

The third mechanism for\nheat transfer needs no medium; it is called\nradiation and the energy so transferred by\nelectromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.\nIn an electromagnetic wave, electric and\nmagnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like\nany wave, electromagnetic waves can have\ndifferent wavelengths and can travel in vacuum\nwith the same speed, namely the speed of light\ni.e., 3 × 108 m s–1 . You will learn these matters in\nmore detail later, but you now know why heat\ntransfer by radiation does not need any medium\nand why it is so fast. This is how heat is\ntransferred to the earth from the Sun through\nempty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,\nwhether they are solid, liquid or gas. The\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by\nvirtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red\nhot iron or light from a filament lamp is called\nthermal radiation.\nWhen this ther mal radiation falls on other\nbodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.\nThe amount of heat that a body can absorb by\nradiation depends on the colour of the body.\nWe find that black bodies absorb and emit\nradiant energy better than  bodies of lighter\ncolours. This fact finds many applications in our\ndaily life. We wear white or light coloured clothes\nin summer, so that they absorb the least heat\nfrom the Sun. However, during winter, we use\ndark coloured clothes, which absorb heat from\nthe sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of\nutensils for cooking food are blackened so that\nthey absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer\nit to the vegetables to be cooked.\nSimilarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is\na device to minimise heat transfer between the\ncontents of the bottle and outside. It consists\nof a double-walled glass vessel with the inner\nand outer walls coated with silver . Radiation\nfrom the inner wall is reflected back to the\ncontents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly\nreflects back any incoming radiation. The space\nbetween the walls is evacuted to r educe\nconduction and convection losses and the flask\nis supported on an insulator , like cork. The\ndevice is, ther efore, useful for pr eventing hot\ncontents (like, milk) from getting cold, or\nalternatively, to store cold contents (like, ice).",

    "content": "10.9.4 Blackbody Radiation\nWe have so far not mentioned the wavelength\ncontent of thermal radiation. The important\nthing about thermal radiation at any\ntemperature is that it is not of one (or a few)\nwavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum\nfrom the small to the long wavelengths. The\nenergy content of radiation, however, varies for\ndifferent wavelengths. Figure 10.18 gives the\nexperimental curves for radiation energy per unit\narea per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody\nversus wavelength for different temperatures.\nFig. 10.18:  Energy emitted versus wavelength\nfor a blackbody at different\ntemperatures\nNotice that the wavelength λm for which energy\nis the maximum decreases with increasing\ntemperature. The relation between λm and T is\ngiven by what is known as Wien’s Displacement\nLaw:\nλm T  =  constant (10.15)\nThe value of the constant (Wien’s constant)\nis 2.9 × 10 –3 m K. This law explains why the\ncolour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame\nfirst becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and\nfinally white hot. Wien’s law is useful for\nestimating the surface temperatures of celestial\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 219\nbodies like, the moon, Sun and other stars. Light\nfrom the moon is found to have a maximum\nintensity near the wavelength 14 µm. By Wien’s\nlaw, the surface of the moon is estimated to have\na temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a\nmaximum at λm = 4753 Å. This corresponds to\nT = 6060 K. Remember, this is the temperature\nof the surface of the sun, not its interior.\nThe most significant feature of the\nblackbody radiation curves in Fig. 10.18 is that\nthey are universal. They depend only on the\ntemperature and not on the size, shape or\nmaterial of the blackbody. Attempts to explain\nblackbody radiation theoretically, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, spurred the\nquantum revolution in physics, as you will\nlearn in later courses.\nEnergy can be transferred by radiation over\nlarge distances, without a medium (i.e. , in\nvacuum). The total electromagnetic energy\nradiated by a body at absolute temperature T\nis proportional to its size, its ability to radiate\n(called emissivity)  and most importantly to its\ntemperature. For a body , which is a perfect\nradiator, the ener gy emitted per unit time ( H)\nis given by\nH = A\nσT 4 (10.16)\nwhere A is the area and T is the absolute\ntemperature of the body.  This relation obtained\nexperimentally by Stefan and later proved\ntheoretically by Boltzmann is known as Stefan-\nBoltzmann law  and the constant\nσ is called\nStefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units\nis 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4. Most bodies emit only a\nfraction of the rate given by Eq. 10.16. A substance\nlike lamp black comes close to the limit. One,\ntherefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e\ncalled emissivity and writes,\nH = Ae\nσT 4 (10.17)\nHere, e = 1 for a perfect radiator. For a tungsten\nlamp, for example, e is about 0.4. Thus, a tungsten\nlamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface\narea of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate  H = 0.3 ×\n10–4 × 0.4 × 5.67 × 10–8 × (3000)4 = 60 W.\nA body at temperature T, with surroundings\nat temperatures Ts, emits, as well as, receives\nenergy. For a per fect radiator, the net rate of\nloss of radiant energy is\nH = σA (T 4 – Ts\n4)\nFor a body with emissivity e, the relation\nmodifies to\nH = eσ A (T4 – Ts\n4) (10.18)\nAs an example, let us estimate the heat\nradiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area\nof a person’s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room\ntemperature is 22 °C. The internal body\ntemperature, as we know, is about 37 °°C.  The\nskin temperature may be 28° °C (say). The\nemissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the\nrelevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The\nrate of heat loss is:\nH = 5.67 × 10–8 × 1.9 × 0.97 × {(301)4 – (295)4}\n= 66.4 W\nwhich is more than half the rate of energy\nproduction by the body at rest (120 W). To\nprevent this heat loss effectively (better than\nordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has\nan additional thin shiny metallic layer next to\nthe skin, which reflects the body’s radiation.",

To\nstudy how slow or fast a given body can cool on\nexchanging heat with its surroundings, let us\nperform the following activity.\nTake some water , say 300 mL, in a\ncalorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a\ntwo-holed lid. Fix the stirrer through one hole\nand fix a thermometer through another hole\nin the lid and make sure that the bulb of\nthermometer is immersed in the water . Note\nthe reading of the ther mometer. This reading\nT1 is the temperature of the surroundings.\nHeat the water kept in the calorimeter till it\nattains a temperature, say 40  °C above room\ntemperature (i.e., temperature of the\nsurroundings). Then, stop heating the water\nby removing the heat source. Start the\nstop-watch and note the reading of the\nthermometer after a fixed interval of time, say\nafter every one minute of stirring gently with\nthe stirr er. Continue to note the temperatur e\n(T2) of water till it attains a temperature about\n5 °C above that of the surroundings. Then, plot\n220 PHYSICS\na graph by taking each value of temperature\n∆T = T2 – T1 along y-axis and the coresponding\nvalue of  t along x-axis (Fig. 10.19).\nFig. 10.19 Curve showing cooling of hot water\nwith time.\nFrom the graph you can infer how the cooling\nof hot water depends on the difference of its\ntemperature from that of the surroundings. You\nwill also notice that initially the rate of cooling\nis higher and decreases as the temperature of\nthe body falls.\nThe above activity shows that a hot body loses\nheat to its surroundings in the form of heat\nradiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on\nthe difference in temperature between the body\nand its surroundings. Newton was the first to\nstudy, in a systematic manner , the r elation\nbetween the heat lost by a body in a given\nenclosure and its temperature.\nAccording to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate\nof loss of heat, – d Q/dt of the body is directly\nproportional to the difference of temperature\n∆T = (T2–T1) of the body and the surroundings.\nThe law holds good only for small difference of\ntemperature. Also, the loss of  heat by radiation\ndepends upon the nature of the surface of the\nbody and the ar ea of the exposed sur face. We\ncan write\n–\n(10.19)\nwhere k is a positive constant depending upon\nthe area and nature of the surface of the body.\nSuppose a body of mass m and specific heat\ncapacity s is at temperatur e T2. Let T1 be the\ntemperatur e of the surr oundings. If the\ntemperature falls by a small amount dT2 in time\ndt, then the amount of heat lost is\ndQ =\nms dT2\n∴ Rate of loss of heat is given by\ndQ\ndt ms dT\ndt= 2\n(10.20)\nFrom Eqs. (10.15) and (10.16) we have\n– ( – )m s dT\ndt k T T2\n2 1=\ndT\nT T\nk\nms dt K dt2\n2 1– – –= = (10.21)\nwhere K = k/m s\nOn integrating,\nloge (T2 – T1) = – K t + c (10.22)\nor T2 = T1 + C′ e–Kt; where C′ = ec (10.23)\nEquation (10.23) enables you to calculate the\ntime of cooling of a body through a particular\nrange of temperature.\nFor small temperature differences, the rate\nof cooling, due to conduction, convection, and\nradiation combined, is proportional to the\ndifference in temperature. It is a valid\napproximation in the transfer of heat from a\nradiator to a room, the loss of heat through the\nwall of a room, or the cooling of a cup of tea on\nthe table.\nFig. 10.20 Verification of Newton’s Law of cooling.\nNewton’s law of cooling can be verified with\nthe help of the experimental set-up shown in\nFig. 10.20(a). The set-up consists of a double-\nwalled vessel (V) containing water  between\nthe two walls. A copper calorimeter (C)\ncontaining hot water is placed inside the\ndouble-walled vessel. Two thermometers\nthrough the corks are used to note the\ntemperatures T2 of water in calorimeter and\nT1 of hot water in between the double walls,\nrespectively. Temperature of hot water in the\ncalorimeter is noted after equal intervals of\ntime. A graph is plotted between lo g e (T2–T1)\n[or ln(T2–T1)] and time ( t). The nature of the\n∆\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 221\n⊳\ngraph is observed to be a straight line having\na negative slope as shown in Fig. 10.20(b). This\nis in support of Eq. 10.22.",

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. Heat is a form of energy that flows between a body and its surrounding medium by\nvirtue of temperatur e difference between them. The degr ee of hotness of the body is\nquantitatively r epresented by temperatur e.\n2. A temperature-measuring device (thermometer) makes use of some measurable property\n(called thermometric property) that changes with temperature. Different thermometers\nlead to different temperature scales. To construct a temperature scale, two fixed points\nare chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperatur e. The two numbers fix\nthe origin of the scale and the size of its unit.\n3. The Celsius temperatur e (tC) and the Far enheit temperare (tF)are related by\ntF = (9/5) tC + 32\n4. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P), volume (V) and absolute temperature (T)\nis :\nPV = µRT\nwhere µ is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.\n5. In the absolute temperature scale, the zero of the scale  corresponds to the temperature\nwhere every substance in nature has the least possible molecular activity. The Kelvin\nabsolute temperature scale ( T ) has the same unit size as the Celsius scale ( Tc ), but\ndiffers in the origin :\nTC   =  T – 273.15\n6. The coef ficient of linear expansion (\nαl ) and volume expansion ( αv ) are defined by the\nrelations :\nl\nl Tl α∆ = ∆\nV\nV TV α∆ = ∆\n( )° °8 C = 70 C2 min K\nThe average of 69 °C and 71 °C is 70 °C, which\nis 50 °C above room temperature. K is the same\nfor this situation as for the original.\n°2 C\nTime  = K (50 °C)\nWhen we divide above two equations, we\nhave\n8 C/2 min (70 C)=2 C/time (50 C)\nK\nK\n° °\n° °\nTime = 0.7 min\n= 42 s ⊳\n222 PHYSICS\nwhere ∆l  and  ∆V denote the change in length l and volume V for a change of temperature\n∆T.  The relation between them is :\nαv  =  3 αl\n7. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\ns m\nQ\nT= 1 ∆\n∆\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n1 QC Tµ\n∆= ∆\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance.\n8. The latent heat of fusion ( Lf) is the heat per unit mass r equired to change a substance\nfrom solid into liquid at the same temperatur e and pressur e. The latent heat of\nvaporisation (Lv) is the heat per unit mass r equired to change a substance fr om liquid\nto the vapour state without change in the temperatur e and pressure.\n9. The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.\n10. In conduction, heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through\nmolecular collisions, without any flow of matter .  For a bar of length L and unifor m\ncross section A with its ends maintained at temperatur es TC and TD, the rate of flow of\nheat H is :\nC D\nT T\nH = K A L\n−\nwhere K is the ther mal conductivity of the material of the bar .\n11. Newton’s Law of Cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the\nexcess temperature of the body over the surroundings :\n2 1\nd ( )d\nQ = – k T  – T    t\nWhere T1 is the temperature of the surrounding medium and T2 is the temperature of\nthe body.\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 223",

We shall study the processes where work is\nconverted into heat and vice versa. In winter , when we rub\nour palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing\nproduces the  ‘heat’.  Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’\nof the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons,\nwhich in turn rotate the wheels of the train.\nIn physics, we need to define the notions of heat,\ntemperature, work, etc. more carefully.  Historically, it took a\nlong time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the\nmodern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid\nfilling in the pores of a substance.  On contact between a hot\nbody and a cold body, the fluid  (called caloric) flowed from\nthe colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens\nwhen a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water\nup to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of\nwater in the two tanks are the same.  Likewise, in the ‘caloric’\npicture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the\ntemperatures) equalise.\nIn time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in\nfavour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An\nimportant experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin\nThomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He\nobserved that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of\nheat, indeed enough to boil water . More significantly, the\namount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the\nhorses employed for turning the drill) but not on the\nsharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill\nwould scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this\nwas not observed. A most natural explanation of the\nobservations was that heat was a form of energy and the\nexperiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form\nto another–from work to heat.\n11.1 Introduction\n11.2 Thermal equilibrium\n11.3 Zeroth law of\nThermodynamics\n11.4 Heat, internal energy and\nwork\n11.5 First law of\nthermodynamics\n11.6 Specific heat capacity\n11.7 Thermodynamic state\nvariables and equation of\nstate\n11.8 Thermodynamic processes\n11.9 Second law of\nthermodynamics\n11.10 Reversible and irreversible\nprocesses\n11.11 Carnot engine",

Thermodynamics is a macroscopic\nscience. It deals with bulk systems and does not\ngo into the molecular constitution of matter. In\nfact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the\nnineteenth century before the molecular picture\nof matter was firmly established.  Thermodynamic\ndescription involves relatively few macroscopic\nvariables of the system, which are suggested by\ncommon sense and can be usually measured\ndirectly. A microscopic description of a gas, for\nexample, would involve specifying the co-ordinates\nand velocities of the huge number of molecules\nconstituting the gas. The description in kinetic\ntheory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve\nmolecular distribution of velocities.\nThermodynamic description of a gas, on the other\nhand, avoids the molecular description altogether.\nInstead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is\nspecified by macroscopic variables such as\npressure, volume, temperature, mass and\ncomposition that  are felt by our sense perceptions\nand are measurable*.\nThe distinction between mechanics and\nthermodynamics is worth bearing in mind.  In\nmechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles\nor bodies under the action of forces and torques.\nThermodynamics is not concerned with the\nmotion of the system as a whole.  It is concerned\nwith the internal macroscopic state of the body.\nWhen a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes\nis the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic\nenergy, in particular), not its temperature.  When\nthe bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic\nenergy of the bullet gets converted into heat,\nchanging the temperature of the bullet and the\nsurrounding layers of wood.  Temperature is\nrelated to the energy of the internal (disordered)\nmotion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet\nas a whole.",

For example, a gas inside a closed\nrigid container, completely insulated fr om its\nsurroundings, with fixed values of pressure,\nvolume, temperature, mass and composition that\ndo not change with time, is in a state of\nthermodynamic equilibrium.\nFig. 11.1 (a) Systems A and B (two gases) separated\nby an adiabatic wall – an insulating wall\nthat does not allow flow of heat.

In\nthis case, thermal equilibrium is attained\nin due course.\nIn general, whether or not a system is in a state\nof equilibrium depends on the surroundings and\nthe nature of the wall that separates the system\nfrom the surroundings.  Consider two gases A and\nB occupying two different containers. We know\nexperimentally that pressure and volume of a\ngiven mass of gas can be chosen to be its two\nindependent variables.

Enthalpy is a measure of total heat content of the system.\nPHYSICS228\nadiabatic wall  – an insulating wall (can be\nmovable) that does not allow flow of energy (heat)\nfrom one to another. The systems are insulated\nfrom the rest of the surroundings also by similar\nadiabatic walls. The situation is shown\nschematically in Fig. 11.1 (a). In this case, it is\nfound that any possible pair of values (PA, VA) will\nbe in equilibrium with any possible pair of values\n(PB, VB).  Next, suppose that the adiabatic wall is\nreplaced by a diathermic wall – a conducting wall\nthat allows energy flow (heat) from one to another.\nIt is then found that the macroscopic variables of\nthe systems A and B change spontaneously until\nboth the systems attain equilibrium states. After\nthat there is no change in their states. The\nsituation is shown in Fig. 11.1(b).  The pressure\nand volume variables of the two gases change to\n(PB ′, VB ′) and (PA ′, VA ′) such that the new states\nof A and B are in equilibrium with each other*.\nThere is no more energy flow from one to another.\nWe then say that the system A is in ther mal\nequilibrium with the system B.\nWhat characterises the situation of thermal\nequilibrium between two systems ?

The\nstates of the systems (i.e. , their macroscopic\nvariables) will change until both A and B come to\nthermal equilibrium with C. After this is achieved,\nsuppose that the adiabatic wall between A and B\nis replaced by a conducting wall and C is insulated\nfrom A and B by an adiabatic wall [Fig.11.2(b)]. It\nis found that the states of A and B change no\nfurther i.e. they are found to be in thermal\nequilibrium with each other. This observation\nforms the basis of the Zeroth Law of\nThermodynamics , which states that ‘two\nsystems in thermal equilibrium with a third\nsystem separately are in thermal equilibrium\nwith each other’.  R.H. Fowler formulated this\nlaw in 1931 long after the first and second Laws\nof thermodynamics were stated and so numbered.\nThe Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two\nsystems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium,\nthere must be a physical quantity that has the\nsame value for both. This thermodynamic\nvariable whose value is equal for two systems in\nthermal equilibrium is called temperature ( T ).\nThus, if A and B are separately in equilibrium\nwith C, TA = TC  and TB = TC.  This implies that\nTA = TB i.e. the systems A and B are also in\nthermal equilibrium.\nWe have arrived at the concept of temperature\nformally via the Zeroth Law.  The next question\nis : how to assign numerical values to\ntemperatures of different bodies ?  In other words,\nhow do we construct a scale of temperature  ?\nThermometry deals with this basic question to\nwhich we turn in the next section.\nFig. 11.2 (a) Systems A and B are separated by an\nadiabatic wall, while each is in contact\nwith a third system C via a conducting\nwall.

    "content": "11.4  HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK\nThe Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to\nthe concept of temperature that agrees with our\ncommonsense notion.  Temperature is a marker\nof the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the\ndirection of flow of heat when two bodies are\nplaced in thermal contact.  Heat flows from the\nbody at a higher temperature to the one at lower\ntemperature. The flow stops when the\ntemperatures equalise; the two bodies are then\nin thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail\nhow to construct temperature scales to assign\ntemperatures to dif ferent bodies. W e now\ndescribe the concepts of heat and other relevant\nquantities like internal energy and work.\nThe concept of internal energy of a system is\nnot difficult to understand.  We know that every\nbulk system consists of a large number of\nmolecules.  Internal energy is simply the sum of\nthe kinetic energies and potential energies of\nthese molecules. W e remarked earlier that in\nthermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the\nsystem, as a whole, is not relevant.  Internal\nenergy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and\npotential energies in the frame of reference\nrelative to which the centre of mass of the system\nis at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered)\nenergy associated with the random motion of\nmolecules of the system. We denote the internal\nenergy of a system by U.\nThough we have invoked the molecular\npicture to understand the meaning of internal\nenergy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned,\nU is simply a macroscopic variable of the system.\nThe important thing about internal energy is\nthat it depends only on the state of the system,\nnot on how that state was achieved.  Internal\nenergy U of a system is an example of a\nthermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value\ndepends only on the given state of the system,\nnot on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive\nat that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given\nmass of gas depends on its state described by\nspecific values of pressure, volume and\ntemperature. It does not depend on how this\nstate of the gas came about. Pressure, volume,\ntemperature, and internal energy are\nthermodynamic state variables of the system\n(gas) (see section 11.7). If we neglect the small\nintermolecular forces in a gas, the internal\nenergy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies\nassociated with various random motions of its\nmolecules.  We will see in the next chapter that\nin a gas this motion is not only translational\n(i.e. motion from one point to another in the\nvolume of the container); it also includes\nrotational and vibrational motion of the\nmolecules (Fig. 11.3).\nFig. 11.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum\nof the kinetic and potential energies of  its\nmolecules when the box is at rest. Kinetic\nenergy due to various types of motion\n(translational, rotational, vibrational) is to\nbe included in U.  (b) If the same box is\nmoving as a whole with some velocity,\nthe kinetic energy of the box is not to be\nincluded in U.\nFig. 11.4 Heat and work are two distinct modes of\nenergy transfer to a system that results  in\nchange in its internal energy. (a) Heat is\nenergy transfer due to temperature\ndifference between the system and the\nsurroundings.  (b) Work is energy transfer\nbrought about by means (e.g. moving the\npiston by raising or lowering some weight\nconnected to it) that do not involve such a\ntemperature difference.\nPHYSICS230\nWhat are the ways of changing internal\nenergy of a system ? Consider again, for\nsimplicity, the system to be a certain mass of\ngas contained in a cylinder with a movable\npiston as shown in Fig. 11.4.  Experience shows\nthere are two ways of changing the state of the\ngas (and hence its internal energy).  One way is\nto put the cylinder in contact with a body at a\nhigher temperature than that of the gas. The\ntemperature difference will cause a flow of\nenergy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas,\nthus increasing the internal energy of the gas.\nThe other way is to push the piston down i.e. to\ndo work on the system, which again results in\nincreasing the internal energy of the gas.  Of\ncourse, both these things could happen in the\nreverse direction. With surroundings at a lower\ntemperature, heat would flow from the gas to\nthe surroundings.  Likewise, the gas could push\nthe piston up and do work on the surroundings.\nIn short, heat and work are two different modes\nof altering the state of a thermodynamic system\nand changing its internal energy.\nThe notion of heat should be carefully\ndistinguished from the notion of internal energy.\nHeat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in\ntransit.  This is not just a play of words.  The\ndistinction is of basic significance. The state of\na thermodynamic system is characterised by its\ninternal energy, not heat. A statement like ‘a\ngas in a given state has a certain amount of\nheat’ is as meaningless as the statement that\n‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount\nof work’.  In contrast, ‘a gas in a given state\nhas a certain amount of internal energy’ is a\nperfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the\nstatements ‘a certain amount of heat is\nsupplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount\nof work was done by the system’ are perfectly\nmeaningful.\nTo summarise, heat and work in\nthermodynamics are not state variables. They\nare modes of energy transfer to a system\nresulting in change in its internal energy,\nwhich, as already mentioned, is a state variable.\nIn ordinary language, we often confuse heat\nwith internal energy.  The distinction between\nthem is sometimes ignored in elementary\nphysics books. For proper understanding of\nthermodynamics, however , the distinction is\ncrucial.",

    "content": "11.5  FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\nWe have seen that the inter nal energy U of a\nsystem can change through two modes of energy\ntransfer : heat and work.  Let\n∆Q = Heat supplied to the system by the\nsurroundings\n∆W = Work done by the system on  the\nsurroundings\n∆U = Change in internal energy of the system\nThe general principle of conservation of\nenergy then implies that\n∆Q =  ∆U + ∆W (11.1)\ni.e. the energy (∆Q) supplied to the system goes\nin partly to increase the internal energy of the\nsystem ( ∆U) and the rest in work on the\nenvironment (∆W). Equation (11.1) is known as\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics.  It is simply\nthe general law of conservation of energy applied\nto any system in which the energy transfer from\nor to the surroundings is taken into account.\nLet us put Eq. (11.1) in the alternative form\n∆Q  – ∆W  = ∆U (11.2)\nNow, the system may go from an initial state\nto the final state in a number of ways. For\nexample, to change the state of a gas from\n(P1, V1) to ( P2, V2), we can first change the\nvolume of the gas from V1 to V2, keeping its\npressure constant i.e. we can first go the state\n(P1, V2) and then change the pressure of the\ngas from P1 to P2, keeping volume constant, to\ntake the gas to ( P2, V2).  Alternatively, we can\nfirst keep the volume constant and then keep\nthe pressure constant. Since U is a state\nvariable, ∆U depends only on the initial and\nfinal states and not on the path taken by the\ngas to go fr om one to the other . However , ∆Q\nand ∆W will, in general, depend on the path\ntaken to go from the initial to final states. From\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics,  Eq. (11.2),\nit is clear that the combination ∆Q – ∆W, is\nhowever, path independent. This shows that\nif a system is taken through a process in which\n∆U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of\nan ideal gas, see section 1 1.8),\n∆Q  = ∆W\ni.e., heat supplied to the system is used up\nentirely by the system in doing work on the\nenvironment.\nTHERMODYNAMICS 231\nIf the system is a gas in a cylinder with a\nmovable piston, the gas in moving the piston does\nwork. Since force is pressure times area, and\narea times displacement is volume, work done\nby the system against a constant pressure P is\n∆W  = P ∆V\nwhere ∆V is the change in volume of the gas.\nThus, for this case, Eq. (11.1) gives\n∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V (11.3)\nAs an applicatio n of Eq. (11.3), consider the\nchange in internal energy for 1 g of water when\nwe go from its liquid to vapour phase. The\nmeasured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e.,\nfor 1 g of water ∆Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric\npressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm 3 in\nliquid phase and 1671 cm 3 in vapour phase.\nTherefore,\n∆W =P (Vg –Vl ) = 1.013 ×105 × (1671 × 10–6) =169.2 J\nEquation (11.3) then gives\n∆U = 2256 – 169.2  =  2086.8 J\nWe see that most of the heat goes to increase\nthe internal energy of water in transition from\nthe liquid to the vapour phase.",

The agreement is\nknown to break down at low temperatures.\nSpecific heat capacity of water\nThe old unit of heat was calorie.  One calorie\nwas earlier defined to be the amount of heat\nrequired to raise the temperature of 1g of water\nby 1°C. With more precise measurements, it was\nfound that the  specific heat of water varies\nslightly with temperature.  Figure 1 1.5 shows\nthis variation in the temperature range 0 to\n100 °C.\nFig. 11.5 Variation of specific heat capacity of\nwater with temperature.\nFor a precise definition of calorie, it was,\ntherefore, necessary to specify the unit\ntemperature interval. One calorie is defined\nto be the amount of heat required to raise the\ntemperature of 1g of water from 14.5  °C to\n15.5 °C. Since heat is just a form of energy,\nit is preferable to use the unit joule, J.\nIn SI units, the specific heat  capacity of water\nis 4186 J kg –1 K–1 i.e. 4.186 J g –1 K–1. The so\ncalled mechanical equivalent of heat defined\nas the amount of work needed to produce\n1 cal of heat is in fact just a conversion factor\nbetween two different units of energy : calorie\nto joule. Since in SI units, we use the unit joule\nfor heat, work or any other form of energy, the\nterm mechanical equivalent is now\nsuperfluous and need not be used.\nAs already remarked, the specific heat\ncapacity depends on the process or the\nconditions under which heat capacity transfer\ntakes place.  For gases, for example, we can\ndefine two specific heats  : specific heat\ncapacity at constant volume and specific\nheat capacity at constant pressure .  For an\nideal gas, we have a simple relation.\nCp  –  Cv = R (11.8)\nwhere Cp and Cv  are molar specific heat\ncapacities of an ideal gas at constant pressure\nand volume respectively and R is the universal\ngas constant.  To prove the relation, we begin\nwith Eq.

    "content": "11.8.1  Quasi-static process\nConsider a gas in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings. The pressure\nof the gas in that case equals the external\npressure and its temperature is the same as\nthat of its surroundings. Suppose that the\nexternal pressure is suddenly reduced (say by\nlifting the weight on the movable piston in the\ncontainer).  The piston will accelerate outward.\nDuring the process, the gas passes through\nstates that are not equilibrium states. The non-\nequilibrium states do not have well-defined\npressure and temperature. In the same way, if\na finite temperature difference exists between\nthe gas and its surroundings, there will be a\nrapid exchange of heat during which the gas\nwill pass through non-equilibrium states.  In\ndue course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium\nstate with well-defined temperature and\npressure equal to those of the surroundings. The\nfree expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture\nof gases undergoing an explosive chemical\nreaction, mentioned in section 11.7 are also\nexamples where the system goes through non-\nequilibrium states.\nNon-equilibrium states of a system are difficult\nto deal with.  It is, therefore, convenient to\nimagine an idealised process in which at every\nstage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a\n* As emphasised earlier, Q is not a state variable.  However, ∆Q is clearly proportional to the total mass of\nsystem and hence is extensive.\nPHYSICS234\nprocess is, in principle, infinitely slow, hence the\nname quasi-static (meaning nearly static). The\nsystem changes its variables (P, T, V ) so slowly\nthat it remains in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings throughout.\nIn a quasi-static process, at every stage, the\ndifference in the pressure of the system and the\nexternal pressure is infinitesimally small.  The\nsame is true of the temperature difference\nbetween the system and its surroundings\n(Fig.11.7).  To take a gas from the state (P, T ) to\nanother state (P ′, T ′ ) via  a quasi-static process,\nwe change the external pressure by a very small\namount, allow the system to equalise its pressure\nwith that of the surroundings and continue the\nprocess infinitely slowly until the system\nachieves the pressure P ′. Similarly, to change\nthe temperature, we introduce an infinitesimal\ntemperature difference between the system and\nthe surrounding reservoirs and by choosing\nreservoirs of progressively different temperatures\nT to T ′, the system achieves the temperature T ′.\nFig. 11.7 In a quasi-static process, the temperature\nof the surrounding reservoir and the\nexternal pressure differ only infinitesimally\nfrom the temperature and pressure of the\nsystem.\nA quasi-static process is obviously a\nhypothetical construct.  In practice, processes\nthat are sufficiently slow and do not involve\naccelerated motion of the piston, large\ntemperature gradient, etc., are reasonably\napproximation to an ideal quasi-static process.\nWe shall fr om now on deal with quasi-static\nprocesses only, except when stated otherwise.\nA process in which the temperature of the\nsystem is kept fixed throughout is called an\nisothermal process.  The expansion of a gas in\na metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of\nfixed temperature is an example of an isothermal\nprocess.  (Heat transferred from the reservoir to\nthe system does not materially affect the\ntemperature of the reservoir, because of its very\nlarge heat capacity.)  In isobaric processes the\npressure is constant while in isochoric\nprocesses the volume is constant. Finally, if the\nsystem is insulated from the surroundings and\nno heat flows between the system and the\nsurroundings, the process is adiabatic.

Common\nexperience shows that there are many\nconceivable processes that are perfectly\nallowed by the First Law and yet are never\nobserved.  For example, nobody has ever seen\na book lying on a table jumping to a height by\nitself.  But such a thing would be possible if\nthe principle of conservation of energy were\nthe only restriction. The table could cool\nspontaneously, converting some of its internal\nenergy into an equal amount of mechanical\nenergy of the book, which would then hop to a\nheight with potential energy equal to the\nmechanical energy it acquired.  But this never\nhappens. Clearly, some additional basic\nprinciple of nature forbids the above, even\nthough it satisfies the energy conservation\nprinciple.  This principle, which  disallows\nmany phenomena consistent with the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics is known as the\nSecond Law of Thermodynamics.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics gives\na fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a\nheat engine and the co-efficient of\nperformance of a refrigerator. In simple terms,\nit says that efficiency of a heat engine can\nnever be unity. For a r efrigerator , the Second\nLaw says that the co-efficient of performance\ncan never be infinite.  The following two\nstatements, one due to Kelvin and Planck\ndenying the possibility of a perfect heat engine,\nand another due to Clausius denying the\npossibility of a perfect refrigerator or heat\npump, are a concise summary of these\nobservations.\nKelvin-Planck statement\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the\nabsorption of heat from a reservoir and the\ncomplete conversion of the heat into work.\nClausius statement\nNo process is possible whose sole result is the\ntransfer of heat from a colder object to a\nhotter object.\nIt can be proved that the two statements\nabove are completely equivalent.",

During the process the system absorbs heat Q\nfrom the surroundings and performs work W on\nit. Can we reverse this process and bring both\nthe system and surroundings to their initial\nstates with no other effect anywhere? Experience\nsuggests that for most processes in nature this\nis not possible. The spontaneous processes of\nnature are irreversible. Several examples can be\ncited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter\nthan its other parts. When the vessel is removed,\nheat is transferred from the base to the other\nparts, bringing the vessel to a uniform\ntemperature (which in due course cools to the\ntemperature of the surroundings). The process\ncannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not\nget cooler spontaneously and warm up the base.\nIt will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics,\nif it did. The free expansion of a gas is irreversible.\nThe combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol\nand air ignited by a spark cannot be reversed.\nCooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the\nkitchen diffuses to the entire room. The diffusion\nprocess will not spontaneously reverse and bring\nthe gas back to the cylinder . The stirring of a\nliquid in thermal contact with a reservoir will\nconvert the work done into heat, increasing the\ninternal ener gy of the r eservoir. The pr ocess\ncannot be reversed exactly; otherwise it would\namount to conversion of heat entirely into work,\nviolating the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\nIrreversibility is a rule rather an exception\nin nature.\nIrreversibility arises mainly from two causes:\none, many processes (like a free expansion, or\nan explosive chemical reaction) take the system\nto non-equilibrium states; two, most processes\ninvolve friction, viscosity and other dissipative\neffects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and\nlosing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor\nand the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming\nto a stop due to viscosity and losing its\nmechanical energy with corresponding gain in\nthe internal energy  of the liquid). Since\ndissipative effects are present everywhere and\ncan be minimised but not fully eliminated, most\nprocesses that we deal with are irreversible.\nTHERMODYNAMICS 237\nA thermodynamic process  (state i → state f )\nis reversible if the process can be turned back\nsuch that both the system and the surroundings\nreturn to their original states, with no other\nchange anywhere else in the universe. From the\npreceding discussion, a reversible process is an\nidealised notion. A process is reversible only if\nit is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the\nsurroundings at every stage) and there are no\ndissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static\nisothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a\ncylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston\nis a reversible process.\nWhy is reversibility such a basic concept in\nthermodynamics ?  As we have seen, one of the\nconcerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency\nwith which heat can be converted into work.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out\nthe possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100%\nefficiency. But what is the highest efficiency\npossible for a heat engine working between two\nreservoirs at temperatures T1 and T2? It turns\nout that a heat engine based on idealised\nreversible processes achieves the highest\nefficiency possible. All other engines involving\nirreversibility in any way (as would be the case\nfor practical engines) have lower than this\nlimiting efficiency.",

    "content": "11.11  CARNOT ENGINE\nSuppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature\nT1 and a cold reservoir at temperature T2.  What\nis the maximum efficiency possible for a heat\nengine operating between the two reservoirs and\nwhat cycle of proces ses should be adopted to\nachieve the maximum efficiency ?  Sadi Carnot,\na French engineer, first considered this question\nin 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the\ncorrect answer, even though the basic concepts\nof heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly\nestablished.\nWe expect the ideal engine operating between\ntwo temperatures to be a reversible engine.\nIrreversibility is associated with dissipative\neffects, as remarked in the preceding section,\nand lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if\nit is quasi-static and non-dissipative.  We have\nseen that a process is not quasi-static if it\ninvolves finite temperature difference between\nthe system and the reservoir.  This implies that\nin a reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures, heat should be absorbed\n(from the hot reservoir) isothermally and\nreleased (to the cold reservoir) isothermally.  We\nthus have identified two steps of the reversible\nheat engine : isothermal process at temperature\nT1 absorbing heat Q1 from the hot reservoir, and\nanother isothermal process at temperature T2\nreleasing heat Q2 to the cold r eservoir . T o\ncomplete a cycle, we need to take the system\nfrom temperature T1 to T2 and then back from\ntemperature T2 to T1.  Which processes should\nwe employ for this purpose that are reversible?\nA little reflection shows that we can only adopt\nreversible adiabatic processes for these\npurposes, which involve no heat flow from any\nreservoir. If we employ any other process that is\nnot adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take\nthe system from one temperature to another, we\nshall need a series of reservoirs in the\ntemperature range T2 to T1 to ensure that at each\nstage the process is quasi-static.  (Remember\nagain that for a process to be quasi-static and\nreversible, there should be no finite temperature\ndifference between the system and the reservoir.)\nBut we are considering a reversible engine that\noperates between only two temperatures. Thus\nadiabatic processes must bring about the\ntemperature change in the system from T1 to T2\nand T2 to T1 in this engine.\nFig. 11.9 Carnot cycle for a heat engine with an\nideal gas as  the working substance.\nA reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures is called a Carnot engine.  We\nhave just argued that such an engine must have\nthe following sequence of steps constituting one\nPHYSICS238\ncycle, called the Carnot cycle, shown in\nFig. 11.9. We have taken the working substance\nof the Carnot engine to be an ideal gas.\n(a) Step 1 → 2 Isothermal expansion of the gas\ntaking its  state from (P1, V1, T1)  to\n(P2, V2, T1).\nThe heat absorbed by the gas ( Q1) from the\nreservoir at temperature T1 is given by\nEq.

Indeed it is the only\nreversible engine possible that works between\ntwo reservoirs at different temperatures.  Each\nstep of the Carnot cycle given in Fig. 11.9 can\nbe reversed. This will amount to taking heat Q2\nfrom the cold reservoir at T2, doing work W on\nthe system, and transferring heat Q1 to the hot\nreservoir. This will be a reversible refrigerator.\nWe next establish the important r esult\n(sometimes called Carnot’s theorem) that\n(a) working between two given temperatures T1\nand T2 of the hot and cold reservoirs respectively,\nno engine can have efficiency more than that of\nthe Carnot engine and (b) the efficiency of the\nCarnot engine is independent of the nature of\nthe working substance.\nTHERMODYNAMICS 239\nTo prove the result (a), imagine a reversible\n(Carnot) engine R and an irreversible engine I\nworking between the same source (hot reservoir)\nand sink (cold reservoir). Let us couple the\nengines, I and R, in such a way so that I acts\nlike a heat engine and R acts as a refrigerator.\nLet I absorb heat Q1 from the source, deliver\nwork W ′ and release the heat Q1- W\n′  to the sink.\nWe arrange so that R returns the same heat Q1\nto the source, taking heat Q2 from the sink and\nrequiring work W = Q1 – Q2 to be done on it.\nNow suppose ηR < ηI i.e. if R were to act\nas an engine it would give less work output\nreservoir and delivers the same amount of  work\nin one cycle, without any change in the source\nor anywhere else. This is clearly against the\nKelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of\nThermodynamics.  Hence the assertion\nηI > ηR\nis wrong.  No engine can have efficiency greater\nthan that of the Carnot engine. A similar\nargument can be constructed to show that a\nreversible engine with one particular substance\ncannot be more efficient than the one using\nanother substance. The maximum efficiency of\na Carnot engine given by Eq. (11.27) is\nindependent of the nature of the system\nperforming the Carnot cycle of operations. Thus\nwe are justified in using an ideal gas as a system\nin the calculation of efficiency η of a Carnot\nengine. The ideal gas has a simple equation of\nstate, which allows us to readily calculate η, but\nthe final result for η, [Eq. (11.27)], is true for\nany Carnot engine.\nThis final remark shows that in a Carnot\ncycle,\n2\n1\n2\n1\nT\nT= Q\nQ\n(11.28)\nis a universal relation independent of  the nature\nof the system.  Here Q1 and Q2 are respectively,\nthe heat absorbed and released isothermally\n(from the hot and to the cold reservoirs) in a\nCarnot engine. Equation (11.28), can, therefore,\nbe used as a relation to define a truly universal\nthermodynamic temperature scale that is\nindependent of any particular properties of the\nsystem used in the Carnot cycle.  Of course, for\nan ideal gas as a working substance, this\nuniversal temperature is the same as the ideal\ngas temperature introduced in section 11.9.\nI\nR\nW\nFig. 11.10 An i rreversible engine (I) coupled to a\nreversible refrigerator (R). If W ′ > W, this\nwould amount to extraction of heat\nW′ – W from the sink and its full\nconversion to work, in contradiction with\nthe Second Law of Thermodynamics.\nthan that of I i.e. W < W ′ for a given Q1. With R\nacting like a r efrigerator , this would mean\nQ2 =  Q1 – W >  Q1 – W ′. Thus, on the  whole,\nthe coupled I-R system extracts heat\n(Q1 – W) – (Q1 – W ′) = (W ′ – W ) from the cold",

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a\nthird system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other’.  The Zeroth Law leads\nto the concept of temperature.\n2. Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the\nmolecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over -all kinetic energy of\nthe system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system.  Heat is the\nenergy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the\nsurroundings. Work is energy transfer brought about by other means, such as moving\nthe piston of a cylinder containing the gas, by raising or lowering some weight connected\nto it.\nPHYSICS240\n3. The first law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to\nany system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and\nwork) is taken into account.  It states that\n∆Q  = ∆U  +  ∆W\nwhere ∆Q is the heat supplied to the system, ∆W is the work done by the system and ∆U\nis the change in internal energy of the system.\n4. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\ns m\nQ\nT= 1 ∆\n∆\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n1 QC Tµ\n∆= ∆\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance. For a solid, the law of equipartition\nof energy gives\nC  =  3 R\nwhich generally agrees with experiment at ordinary temperatures.\nCalorie is the old unit of heat. 1 calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the\ntemperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C.  1 cal  =  4.186 J.\n5. For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume\nsatisfy the relation\nCp – Cv  = R\nwhere R is the universal gas constant.\n6. Equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system are described by state variables. The\nvalue of a state variable depends only on the particular state, not on the path used to\narrive at that state.  Examples of state variables are pressure (P ), volume (V ), temperature\n(T ), and mass (m ).  Heat and work are not state variables.  An Equation of State (like\nthe ideal gas equation PV  =\nµ RT ) is a relation connecting dif ferent state variables.\n7. A quasi-static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system remains in\nthermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings throughout. In a\nquasi-static process, the pressure and temperature of the environment can differ from\nthose of the system only infinitesimally.\n8.

A process is reversible if it can be reversed such that both the system and the surroundings\nreturn to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe.\nSpontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. The idealised reversible process is a\nquasi-static process with no dissipative factors such as friction, viscosity, etc.\n12.

Boyle,\nNewton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of\ngases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic\nparticles. The actual atomic theory got established more than\n150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases\nbased on the idea that the gas  consists of rapidly moving\natoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces,\nwhich are short range for ces that ar e important for solids\nand liquids,  can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory\nwas developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell,\nBoltzmann and others. It has been remarkably successful. It\ngives a molecular interpretation of  pressure and temperature\nof a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and A vogadro’s\nhypothesis. It corr ectly explains specific heat capacities of\nmany gases. It also r elates measurable pr operties of gases\nsuch as viscosity, conduction and dif fusion with molecular\nparameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.\nThis chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.",

    "content": "Exercises\nKINETIC THEORY 245\nin Greece had suggested that matter may consist\nof indivisible constituents. The scientific ‘Atomic\nTheory’  is usually credited to John Dalton. He\nproposed the atomic  theory to explain the laws\nof definite and multiple pr oportions obeyed by\nelements when they combine into compounds.\nThe first law says that any given compound has,\na fixed proportion by mass of its constituents.\nThe second law says that when two elements\nform more than one compound, for a fixed mass\nof one element, the masses of the other elements\nare in ratio of small integers.\nTo explain the laws Dalton suggested, about\n200 years ago,  that the smallest constituents\nof an element are atoms. Atoms of one element\nare identical but dif fer fr om those of other\nelements.  A small number of atoms of each\nelement combine to for m a molecule of the\ncompound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early\n19th century, states:  When gases combine\nchemically to yield another gas, their volumes\nare in the ratios of small integers.  A vogadro’s\nlaw  (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all\ngases at equal temperature and pressure have\nthe same number of molecules.  Avogadro’s law,\nwhen combined with Dalton’s theory explains\nGay  Lussac’s law.  Since the elements are often\nin the form of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory\ncan also be referred to as the molecular theory\nof matter. The theory is now well accepted by\nscientists. However even at the end of the\nnineteenth century there were famous scientists\nwho did not believe in atomic theory !\nFr\nom many observations, in recent times we\nnow know that  molecules (made up of one or\nmor e atoms) constitute matter . Electr on\nmicr oscopes  and scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopes enable us to even see them. The\nsize of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10   m).\nIn solids, which ar e tightly packed, atoms ar e\nspaced about a few  angstr oms (2 Å) apart. In\nliquids the separation between atoms is also\nabout the same.  In liquids the atoms  ar e not\nas rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move\naround. This enables a liquid to flow.  In gases\nthe interatomic distances ar e in tens of\nangstroms.  The average distance a molecule\ncan travel without colliding is called the  mean\nfree path. The mean free path, in gases, is of\nthe order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms\nare much fr eer in gases and can travel long\ndistances without colliding. If they ar e not\nenclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and\nliquids the closeness makes the interatomic force\nimportant. The force has a long range attraction\nand a short range repulsion. The atoms attract\nwhen they are at a few angstroms but repel when\nthey come closer. The static appearance of a gas\nAtomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece\nThough John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in\nancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules.  In the Vaiseshika\nschool of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in\nconsiderable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter.\nIt was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a\nmustard seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms ( Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the\nsmallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic\nmass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and\nwas continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a\ndiatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending\nupon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture\nor by methods that are not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the\nBuddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic\nsize, of the order of 10 –10 m.\nIn ancient Gr eece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The\nword ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in\nshape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed\nby their combination.  The atoms of water wer e smooth and r ound and unable to ‘hook’ on to each\nother, which is why liquid /water flows easily.   The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held\ntogether to form hard substances.  The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns.\nThese fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further , perhaps because they\nwere intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the\nhallmark of modern science.\n246 PHYSICS\n( )–1 –1J mol KpV\nTµ\nis misleading. The gas is full of activity and the\nequilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic\nequilibrium, molecules collide and change their\nspeeds during the collision. Only the average\nproperties are constant.\nAtomic theory is not the end of our quest, but\nthe beginning. We now know that atoms are not\nindivisible or elementary. They consist of a\nnucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made\nup of protons and neutr ons. The pr otons and\nneutrons are again made up of quarks. Even\nquarks may not be the end of the story. Ther e\nmay be string like elementary entities. Natur e\nalways has surprises for us, but the search for\ntruth is often enjoyable and the discoveries\nbeautiful. In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves\nto understanding the behaviour of gases (and a\nlittle bit of solids), as a collection of moving\nmolecules in incessant motion.",

    "content": "12.3   BEHAVIOUR OF GASES\nProperties of gases are easier to understand than\nthose of solids and liquids. This is mainly\nbecause in a gas, molecules ar e far from each\nother and their mutual interactions ar e\nnegligible except when two molecules collide.\nGases at low pressures and high temperatures\nmuch above that at which they liquefy (or\nsolidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation\nbetween their pressure, temperature and volume\ngiven by (see Chapter 10)\nPV = KT (12.1)\nfor a given sample of the gas. Here T is the\ntemperature in kelvin or (absolute)  scale. K is  a\nconstant for the given sample but varies with\nthe volume of the gas. If we now  bring in  the\nidea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional\nto the number of molecules, (say) N in the\nsample. We can write K = N k . Observation tells\nus that this k is same for all gases. It is called\nBoltzmann constant and is denoted by k\nB\n.\nAs\n1 1 2 2\n1 1 2 2\nP V P V\nN T N T=  = constant = kB (12.2)\nif P, V and T are same, then N is also same for all\ngases. This is Avogadro’s hypothesis, that  the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume is\nthe same for all gases at a fixed temperature and\npressure. The number in 22.4 litres of any gas\nis 6.02 × 1023. This is known as Avogadro number\nand is denoted by NA. The mass of 22.4 litres of\nany gas is equal to its molecular weight in grams\nat S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K and\npressure 1 atm). This amount of substance is\ncalled a mole (see Chapter 1 for a more precise\ndefinition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of\nnumbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed\ntemperature and pressure from chemical\nreactions.  Kinetic  theory justifies this hypothesis.\nThe perfect gas equation can be written as\nPV =\nµ RT (12.3)\nwhere  µ   is the number of moles and R  = NA\nkB is a universal constant. The temperature T is\nabsolute temperature.  Choosing kelvin scale for\nabsolute temperature, R = 8.314 J mol –1K–1.\nHere\n0 A\nM N\nM Nµ = = (12.4)\nwhere M is the mass of the gas containing N\nmolecules, M0 is the molar mass and NA the\nAvogadro’s number. Using  Eqs. (12.4) and (12.3)\ncan also be written as\nPV = kB NT or P = kB nT\nP (atm)\nFig.12.1 Real gases approach ideal gas behaviour at\nlow pressures and high temperatures.\nwhere  n is the number density, i.e. number of\nmolecules per unit volume. kB is  the Boltzmann\nconstant introduced above. Its value in SI units\nis 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1.\nAnother useful form of Eq. (12.3) is\n0\nRTP M\nρ= (12.5)\nKINETIC THEORY 247\n⊳\nwhere ρ is the mass density of the gas.\nA gas that satisfies Eq. (12.3) exactly at all\npressures and temperatures is defined to be an\nideal gas. An ideal gas is a simple theor etical\nmodel of a gas. No r eal gas is truly ideal.\nFig. 12.1 shows departures from ideal gas\nbehaviour for a r eal gas at thr ee dif ferent\ntemperatures. Notice that all curves appr oach\nthe ideal gas behaviour for low  pr essures and\nhigh temperatures.\nAt low pressur es or high temperatur es the\nmolecules ar e far apart and molecular\ninteractions are negligible. Without interactions\nthe gas behaves like an ideal one.\nIf we fix µ and T in Eq. (12.3), we get\nPV = constant (12.6)\ni.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of\na given mass of gas varies inversely with volume.\nThis is the famous Boyle’s law. Fig. 12.2  shows\ncomparison between experimental P-V curves\nand the theoretical curves predicted by Boyle’s\nlaw. Once again you see that the  agreement is\ngood at high temperatures and  low pressures.\nNext, if you fix P, Eq. (12.1) shows that V ∝  T i.e.,\nfor a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is\nproportional to its absolute temperatur e T\n(Charles’ law). See Fig. 12.3.\nFig.12.2 Experimental P-V curves (solid lines) for\nsteam at three temperatures compared with\nBoyle’s law (dotted lines). P is in units of 22\natm and V in units of 0.09 litres.\nFinally, consider a mixture of non-interacting\nideal  gases:\nµ\n1\nmoles of gas 1, µ\n2\nmoles of gas 2,\netc. in a vessel of volume V at temperature T and\npressure P. It is then found that the equation  of\nstate of the mixture is :\nPV = ( µ1 + µ2 +…  ) RT (12.7)\ni.e. 1 2 ...RT RTP V Vµ µ= + + (12.8)\n= P1 + P2 + … (12.9)\nClearly P1 =    µ1 R T/V   is the pressure that\ngas 1 would  exert at the same conditions of\nvolume and  temperature if no other gases were\npresent. This is called the partial pressure of the\ngas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal\ngases is the sum of partial pr essures. This is\nDalton’s law of partial pressures.\nFig. 12.3 Experimental T-V curves (solid lines) for CO2\nat three pressures compared with Charles’\nlaw (dotted lines). T is in units of 300 K and\nV in units of 0.13 litres.\nWe next consider some examples which give\nus information about the volume occupied by\nthe molecules and the volume of a single\nmolecule.",

    "content": "12.4.1 Pressure of an Ideal Gas\nConsider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. Take\nthe axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube,\nas shown in Fig. 12.4.  A molecule with velocity\n(vx, v y, v z ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz-\nplane of area A (= l2). Since the collision is elastic,\nthe molecule rebounds with the same velocity;\nits y and z components of velocity do not change\nin the collision but the x-component reverses\nsign. That is, the velocity after collision is\n(-vx, vy, vz ) . The change in momentum of the\nmolecule is:  – mvx – ( mvx) = – 2 mvx . By the\nprinciple of conservation of momentum, the\nmomentum imparted to the wall in the collision\n= 2mvx .\nthe wall. Thus, the number of molecules with\nvelocity (vx, vy, vz )  hitting the wall in time ∆t is\n½A vx  ∆t n, where n is the number of molecules\nper unit volume. The total momentum\ntransferred to the wall by these molecules in\ntime ∆t  is:\nQ = (2mvx) (½ n A vx\n∆t ) (12.10)\nThe force on the wall is the rate of momentum\ntransfer Q/∆t  and pr essure is for ce per unit\narea :\nP =  Q /(A ∆t)  =  n m vx\n2 (12.11)\nActually, all molecules in a gas do not have\nthe same velocity; ther e is a distribution in\nvelocities.  The  above equation, therefore, stands\nfor pressure due to the group of molecules with\nspeed vx  in  the x-direction and n stands for the\nnumber density of that group of molecules. The\ntotal  pressure is obtained by summing over the\ncontribution due to all groups:\nP = n m\n2\nxv (12.12)\nwhere 2\nxv  is the average of  vx\n2  .  Now the gas\nis isotropic, i.e. there is no pr eferred direction\nof velocity of the molecules in the vessel.\nTherefore, by symmetry,\n2\nxv  = 2\nyv  = 2\nzv\n= (1/3) [ 2\nxv  +  2\nyv  + 2\nzv ] = (1/3) 2v (12.13)\nwhere v is the speed and 2v   denotes the mean\nof the squared speed. Thus\nP = (1/3) n m 2v (12.14)\nSome remarks on this derivation. First,\nthough we choose the container to be a cube,\nthe shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For\na vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose\na small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry\nthrough the steps above. Notice that both A and\n∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s\nlaw, given in Ch. 9,  pressure in one portion of\nthe gas  in equilibrium is the same as anywhere\nelse. Second, we have ignored any collisions in\nthe derivation. Though this assumption is\ndifficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively\nsee that it will not lead to erroneous results. The\nnumber of molecules hitting the wall in time ∆t\nwas found to be ½ n Avx ∆t. Now the collisions\nare random and the gas is in a steady state.\nThus, if a molecule with velocity ( vx, v y, v z )\nacquires a  different velocity due to collision with\nsome molecule, there will always be some other\nFig. 12.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with the\nwall of the container.\nTo calculate the force (and pressure) on the\nwall, we need to calculate momentum imparted\nto the wall per unit time. In a small time interval\n∆t, a molecule with x-component of velocity vx\nwill hit the wall if it is within the distance vx ∆t\nfrom the wall. That is, all molecules within the\nvolume Avx ∆t only can hit the wall in time ∆t.\nBut, on the average, half of these are moving\ntowards the wall and the other half away from\n250 PHYSICS\n⊳\nmolecule with a different initial velocity which\nafter a collision acquires the velocity  (vx, vy, vz ).\nIf this were not so, the distribution of velocities\nwould not r emain steady. In any case we ar e\nfinding 2\nxv . Thus, on the whole, molecular\ncollisions (if they ar e not too fr equent and the\ntime spent in a collision is negligible compared\nto time between collisions)  will not af fect the\ncalculation above.",

Since the internal energy E of an ideal\ngas is purely kinetic\n*,\nE = N × (1/2) m 2v (12.16)\nEquation (12.15) then gives :\nPV = (2/3) E (12.17)\nWe are now ready for a kinetic interpretation\nof temperature.

This is a fundamental\nresult relating temperature, a macroscopic\nmeasurable parameter of a gas\n(a thermodynamic variable as it is called) to a\nmolecular quantity, namely the average kinetic\nenergy of a molecule. The two domains are\nconnected by the Boltzmann constant. We note\nin passing that Eq.

With\nthis interpretation of temperature, kinetic theory\nof an ideal gas is completely consistent with the\nideal gas equation and the various gas laws\nbased on it.\nFor a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the\ntotal pressure gets contribution from each gas\nin the mixture.

Motion of a body as a whole fr om one\npoint to another is called translation. Thus, a\nmolecule fr ee to move in space has three\ntranslational degr ees of fr eedom. Each\ntranslational degree of freedom contributes a\nterm that contains square of some variable of\nmotion, e.g., ½ mvx\n2  and similar ter ms in\nvy and vz. In, Eq.

But what\nabout a diatomic gas such as O 2 or N 2? A\nmolecule of O 2 has three translational degrees\nof freedom. But in addition it can also r otate\nabout its centre of mass. Figure 12.6 shows the\ntwo independent axes of rotation 1 and 2, normal\nto the axis joining the two oxygen atoms about\nwhich the molecule can rotate *.

Note that each rotational\ndegree of freedom contributes a term to the\nenergy that contains square of a rotational\nvariable of motion.\nWe have assumed above that the O2 molecule\nis a ‘rigid rotator’, i.e., the molecule does not\nvibrate. This assumption, though found to be\ntrue (at moderate temperatures) for O 2, is not\nalways valid. Molecules, like CO, even at\nmoderate temperatures have a mode of\nvibration, i.e., its atoms oscillate along the\ninteratomic axis like a one-dimensional\noscillator, and contribute a vibrational ener gy\nterm\nεv to the total energy:\nεv m y\nt ky= \n \n +1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2d\nd\nt r vε ε ε= + + ε (12.26)\nwhere k is the force constant of the oscillator\nand y the vibrational co-ordinate.\nOnce again the vibrational energy terms in\nEq. (12.26) contain squared terms of vibrational\nvariables of motion y and dy/dt .\nKINETIC THEORY 253\nAt this point, notice an important feature in\nEq.(12.26). While each translational and\nrotational degree of freedom has contributed only\none ‘squared term’ in Eq.(12.26), one vibrational\nmode contributes two ‘squared terms’ : kinetic\nand potential energies.\nEach quadratic term occurring in the\nexpression for energy is a mode of absorption of\nenergy by the molecule. W e have seen that in\nthermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,\nfor each translational mode of motion, the\naverage energy is ½ kBT. The most elegant\nprinciple of classical statistical mechanics (first\nproved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each\nmode of energy: translational, rotational and\nvibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total\nenergy is equally distributed in all possible\nenergy modes, with each mode having an average\nenergy equal to  ½ kBT. This is known as the law\nof equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each\ntranslational and rotational degree of freedom\nof a molecule contributes ½ kBT  to the energy,\nwhile each vibrational frequency contributes\n2 × ½ kBT  = kBT ,  since a vibrational mode has\nboth kinetic and potential energy modes.\nThe proof of the law of equipartition of energy\nis beyond the scope of this book. Here, we shall\napply the law to predict the specific heats of gases\ntheoretically. Later, we shall also discuss briefly,\nthe application to specific heat  of solids.",

In time ∆t, it sweeps a\nvolume πd2 <v> ∆t wherein any other molecule\nwill collide with it (see Fig. 12.7). If n is the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume, the\nmolecule suffers nπd2 <v> ∆t  collisions in time\n∆t. Thus the rate of collisions is  nπd2 <v> or the\ntime between two successive collisions is on the\naverage,\nτ  = 1/(nπ <v> d2 ) (12.38)\nThe average distance between two successive\ncollisions, called the mean free path l, is :\nl  = <v> τ = 1/(nπd2) (12.39)\nIn this derivation, we imagined the other\nmolecules to be at rest.

Pressure exists everywhere in a fluid.\nAny layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure\nis the same on both sides of the layer.\n2. We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At\nordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance\nin solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100 times\nthe interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule.\n3. The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energy for each degree of freedom\nin thermal equilibrium is ½ k\nB\nT. Each quadratic term in the total energy expression of\na molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives 2\n(not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy modes), corresponding to the\nenergy 2 × ×××× ½ k\nB\nT = k\nB\nT.\n4.

    "content": "13.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn our daily life we come across various kinds of motions.\nYou have already learnt about some of them, e.g., rectilinear\nmotion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are\nnon-repetitive. We have also lear nt about unifor m circular\nmotion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In\nthese cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of\ntime, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have\nenjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both\nthese motions are repetitive in nature but different from the\nperiodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro\nabout a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes\na similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro\nmotion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river , the\npiston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a\nmotion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we\nstudy this motion.\nThe study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its\nconcepts are required for the understanding of many physical\nphenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar\nor the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce\npleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms\nin telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about\ntheir mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make\nthe propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate\nabout their equilibrium positions, the average energy of\nvibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power\nsupply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive\nand negative about the mean value (zero).\nThe description of a periodic motion, in general, and\noscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental\nconcepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude\nand phase. These concepts are developed in the next section.\n13.1 Introduction\n13.2 Periodic and oscillatory\nmotions\n13.3 Simple harmonic motion\n13.4 Simple harmonic motion\nand uniform circular\nmotion\n13.5 Velocity and acceleration\nin simple harmonic motion\n13.6 Force law for simple\nharmonic motion\n13.7 Energy in simple harmonic\nmotion\n13.8 The simple pendulum",

    "content": "13.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS\nFig. 13.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose\nan insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it\ncomes back to the initial point and repeats the\nprocess identically. If you draw a graph of its\nheight above the ground versus time, it would\nlook something like Fig. 13.1 (a). If a child climbs\nup a step, comes down, and repeats the process\nidentically, its height above the ground would\nlook like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the\ngame of bouncing a ball off the ground, between\nyour palm and the ground, its height versus time\ngraph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c).\nNote that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c)\nare sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s\nequation of motion (see section 2.6),\n21\n2 + gth = ut  for downward motion, and\n21\n2 – gth = ut  for upward motion,\nwith different values of u in each case. These\nare examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion\nthat repeats itself at regular intervals of time is\ncalled periodic motion.\nFig. 13.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T\nis shown in each case.\nVery often, the body under going periodic\nmotion has an equilibrium position somewhere\ninside its path. When the body is at this position\nno net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is\nleft there at rest, it remains there forever. If the\nbody is given a small displacement from the\nposition, a force comes into play which tries to\nbring the body back to the equilibrium point,\ngiving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For\nexample, a ball placed in a bowl will be in\nequilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little\nfrom the point, it will perform oscillations in the\nbowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but\nevery periodic motion need not be oscillatory.\nCircular motion is a periodic motion, but it is\nnot oscillatory.\nThere is no significant difference between\noscillations and vibrations. It seems that when\nthe frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,\nthe oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when\nthe frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,\nthe vibration of a string of a musical instrument).\nSimple harmonic motion is the simplest form\nof oscillatory motion. This motion arises when\nthe force on the oscillating body is directly\nproportional to its displacement from the mean\nposition, which is also the equilibrium position.\nFurther, at any point in its oscillation, this force\nis directed towards the mean position.\nIn practice, oscillating bodies eventually\ncome to rest at their equilibrium positions\nbecause of the damping due to friction and other\ndissipative causes.  However, they can be forced\nto remain oscillating by means of some external\nperiodic agency.  We discuss the phenomena of\ndamped and forced oscillations later in the\nchapter.\nAny material medium can be pictured as a\ncollection of a large number of coupled\noscillators. The collective oscillations of the\nconstituents of a medium manifest themselves\nas waves. Examples of waves include water\nwaves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves.\nWe shall study the wave phenomenon in the next\nchapter.",

For periodic motions,\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nOSCILLATIONS 261\nwhich are either too fast or too slow on the scale\nof seconds, other convenient units of time are\nused. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal\nis expressed in units of microseconds (10 –6 s)\nabbreviated as\nµ s. On the other hand, the orbital\nperiod of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days.\nThe Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years.\nThe reciprocal of T gives the number of\nrepetitions that occur per unit time. This\nquantity is called the frequency of the periodic\nmotion. It is represented by the symbol\nν. The\nrelation between ν and T is\nν  = 1/T  (13.1)\nThe unit of ν is thus s–1.

    "content": "13.2.2   Displacement\nIn section 3.2, we defined displacement of a\nparticle as the change in its position vector. In\nthis chapter , we use the ter m displacement\nin a more general sense. It refers to change\nwith time of any physical property under\nconsideration. For example, in case of rectilinear\nmotion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance\nfrom the starting point as a function of time is\nits position displacement. The choice of origin\nis a matter of convenience. Consider a block\nattached to a spring, the other end of the spring\nis fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.13.2(a)]. Generally,\nit is convenient to measure displacement of the\nbody from its equilibrium position. For  an\noscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the\nvertical as a function of time may be regarded\nas a displacement variable [see Fig.13.2(b)]. The\nterm displacement is not always to be referred\nFig. 13.2(a) A block attached to a spring, the other\nend of which is fixed to a rigid wall. The\nblock moves on a frictionless surface. The\nmotion of the block can be described in\nterms of its distance or displacement x\nfrom the equilibrium position.\nFig.13.2(b) An oscillating simple pendulum; its\nmotion can be described in terms of\nangular displacement\nθ from the vertical.\nin the context of position only. There can be\nmany other kinds of displacement variables. The\nvoltage across a capacitor, changing with time\nin an AC circuit, is also a displacement variable.\nIn the same way, pressure variations in time in\nthe propagation of sound wave, the changing\nelectric and magnetic fields in a light wave are\nexamples of displacement in different contexts.\nThe displacement variable may take both\npositive and negative values. In experiments on\noscillations, the displacement is measured for\ndifferent times.\nThe displacement can be represented by a\nmathematical function of time. In case of periodic\nmotion, this function is periodic in time. One of\nthe simplest periodic functions is given by\nf(t) = A cos\nωt (13.3a)\nIf the argument of this function, ωt, is\nincreased by an integral multiple of 2π radians,\nthe value of the function remains the same. The\nPHYSICS262\nfunction f (t) is then periodic and its period, T,\nis given by\nω\nπ2=  T     (13.3b)\nThus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T,\nf (t) = f(t+T )\nThe same result is obviously correct if we\nconsider a sine function, f (t ) = A sin ωt. Further,\na linear combination of sine and cosine functions\nlike,\nf(t)  =  A sin\nωt + B cos ωt                 (13.3c)\nis also a periodic function with the same period\nT. Taking,\nA = D cos\nφ  and  B = D sin φ\nEq. (13.3c) can be written as,\nf (t) = D sin (ωt + φ ) ,                        (13.3d)\nHere D and φ are constant given by\n2 2 1and tanφ =  –D = A + B\nB\nA\n\n \n\nThe great importance of periodic sine and\ncosine functions is due to a remarkable result\nproved by the French mathematician, Jean\nBaptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830): Any\nperiodic function can be expressed as a\nsuperposition of sine and cosine functions\nof different time periods with suitable\ncoefficients.\nu",

    "content": "13.3 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION\nConsider a particle oscillating back and forth\nabout the origin of an x-axis between the limits\n+A and –A as shown in Fig. 13.3. This oscillatory\nmotion is said to be simple harmonic if the\ndisplacement x of the particle from the origin\nvaries with time as :\nx (t) = A cos (ω\nt + φ) (13.4)\nFig. 13.3 A particle vibrating back and forth about\nthe origin of x-axis, between the limits +A\nand –A.\nwhere A,\nω and φ are constants.\nThus, simple harmonic motion (SHM) is not\nany periodic motion but one in which\ndisplacement is a sinusoidal function of time.\nFig. 13.4 shows the positions of a particle\nexecuting SHM at discrete value of time, each\ninterval of time being T/4, where T is the period\nof motion. Fig. 13.5 plots the graph of x versus t,\nwhich gives the values of displacement as a\ncontinuous function of time. The quantities A,\nOSCILLATIONS 263\nω and φ which characterize a given SHM have\nstandard names, as summarised in Fig. 13.6.\nLet us understand these quantities.\nThe amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude\nof maximum displacement of the particle.\n[Note, A can be taken to be positive without\nany loss of generality]. As the cosine function\nof time varies from +1 to –1, the displacement\nvaries between the extremes A and – A. Two\nsimple harmonic motions may have same\nω\nand φ but different amplitudes A and B , as\nshown in Fig. 1 3.7 (a).\nWhile the amplitude A is fixed for a given\nSHM, the state of motion (position and velocity)\nof the particle at any time t is determined by the\nFig. 13.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the\ndiscrete values t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T,\n5T/4. The time after which motion repeats\nitself is T. T will remain fixed, no matter\nwhat location you choose as the initial (t =\n0) location. The speed is maximum for zero\ndisplacement (at x = 0) and zero at the\nextremes of motion.\nFig. 13.5 Displacement as a continuous function of\ntime for simple harmonic motion. Fig. 13.7 (b) A plot obtained from Eq. (13 .4). The\ncurves 3 and 4 are for φ = 0 and - π/4\nrespectively. The amplitude A is same for\nboth the plots.\nFig. 13.7 (a) A plot of displacement as a function of\ntime as obtained from Eq. (14.4) with\nφ = 0.

(13.4)\nargument (ωt + φ) in the cosine function. This\ntime-dependent quantity, ( ωt + φ) is called the\nphase of the motion. The value of plase at t = 0\nis φ and is called the phase constant (or phase\nangle). If the amplitude is known, φ can be\ndetermined from the displacement at t = 0. Two\nsimple harmonic motions may have the same A\nand ω but different phase angle φ, as shown in\nFig. 13.7 (b).\nFinally, the quantity ω can be seen to be\nrelated to the period of motion T. Taking, for\nsimplicity, φ = 0 in Eq. (13.4), we have\nPHYSICS264\nx(t) = A cos ωt   (13.5)\nSince the motion has a period T, x (t) is equal to\nx (t + T). That is,\nA cos ωt = A cos ω (t + T )      (13.6)\nNow the cosine function is periodic with period\n2π, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument\nchanges by 2π. Therefore,\nω(t + T ) = ωt + 2π\nthat is ω = 2π/ T (13.7)\nω is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its\nS.I. unit is radians per second.

    "content": "13.4  SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND\nUNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION\nIn this section,  we show that the projection of\nuniform circular motion on a diameter of the\ncircle follows simple harmonic motion. A\nsimple experiment (Fig. 13.9) helps us visualise\nthis connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string\nand make it move in a horizontal plane about\na fixed point with a constant angular speed.\nThe ball would then perform a uniform circular\nmotion in the horizontal plane. Observe the\nball sideways or from the front, fixing your\nattention in the plane of motion. The ball will\nappear to execute to and fro motion along a\nhorizontal line with the point of rotation as\nthe midpoint. You could alter natively observe\nthe shadow of the ball on a wall which is\nperpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this\nprocess what we are observing is the motion\nof the ball on a diameter of the circle normal\nto the direction of viewing.\nFig. 13.9 Circular motion of a ball in a plane viewed\nedge-on is SHM.\nFig. 13.8   Plots of Eq.

Suppose a particle P is moving\nuniformly on a circle of radius A with angular\nspeed ω. The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.\nThe initial position vector of the particle, i.e.,\nthe vector OP at t = 0 makes an angle of φ with\nthe positive direction of x-axis. In time t, it will\ncover a further angle ωt and its position vector\nOSCILLATIONS 265\nwill make an angle of ωt + φ with the +ve\nx-axis. Next , consider the projection of the\nposition vector OP on the x-axis. This will be\nOP′. The position of P ′ on the x-axis, as the\nparticle P moves on the circle, is given by\nx(t) =  A cos (ωt + φ )\nwhich is the defining equation of SHM. This\nshows that if P moves uniformly on a circle,\nits projection P′ on a diameter of the circle\nexecutes SHM. The particle P and the circle\non which it moves ar e sometimes referred to\nas the reference particle and the reference circle,\nrespectively.\nWe can take projection of the motion of P on\nany diameter, say the y-axis. In that case, the\ndisplacement y(t) of P′ on the y-axis is given by\ny = A sin (ωt + φ)\nwhich is also an SHM of the same amplitude\nas that of the projection on x-axis, but differing\nby a phase of\nπ/2.\nIn spite of this connection between circular\nmotion and SHM, the force acting on a particle\nin linear simple harmonic motion is very\ndifferent from the centripetal force needed to\nkeep a particle in uniform circular motion.\nu",

Fig. 13.17(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’\ndiagram of the simple pendulum showing the\nforces acting on the bob.\nLet\nθ be the angle made by the string with\nthe vertical. When the bob is at the mean\nposition,\nθ = 0\nThere are only two forces acting on the bob;\nthe tension T along the string and the vertical\nOSCILLATIONS 271\nforce due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be\nresolved into the component mg cosθ along the\nstring and mg sinθ perpendicular to it. Since\nthe motion of the bob is along a circle of length\nL and centre at the support point, the bob has\na radial acceleration (ω2L) and also a tangental\nacceleration; the latter arises since motion along\nthe arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial\nacceleration is provided by the net radial force\nT –mg cosθ, while the tangential acceleration is\nprovided by mg sinθ. It is more convenient to\nwork with torque about the support since the\nradial force gives zero torque. Torque\nτ about\nthe support is entirely provided by the tangental\ncomponent of force\nτ =  –L (mg sinθ ) (13.19)\nThis is the restoring torque that tends to reduce\nangular displacement — hence the negative\nsign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,\nτ   =  I α (13.20)\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the system\nabout the support and α is the angular\nacceleration. Thus,\nI α = –m g sin θ   L (13.21)\nOr,\nα  =  sin  m g L  I  θ− (13.22)\nWe can simplify Eq. (13.22) if we assume that\nthe displacement θ is small. We know that sinθ\ncan be expressed as,\nsin  ± ...3! 5!  θ θθ θ\n3 5\n=  − + (13.23)\nwhere θ is in radians.\nNow if θ  is small, sin θ can be approximated\nby θ and Eq. (13.22) can then be written as,\nα θ  =  −  mgL\nI\n(13.24)\nIn Table 1 3.1, we have listed the angle θ in\ndegrees, its equivalent in radians, and the\nvalue of the function sin\nθ . From this table it\ncan be seen that for θ as large as 20 degrees,\nsin θ is nearly the same as θ expressed\nin radians .",

It is related to\nthe frequency v by,\n1T v=\nThe frequency ν of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per\nunit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :\n1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s –1\n3. In simple harmonic motion  (SHM), the displacement x (t) of a particle from its\nequilibrium position is given by,\nx (t)  = A cos (ωt + φ ) (displacement),\nin which A  is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity  ( ωt + φ ) is the phase of\nthe motion, and φ is the phase constant . The angular frequency  ω is related to the\nperiod and frequency of the motion by ,\n2 2    T\nπω πν= = (angular frequency).\n4. Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular\nmotion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.\n5. The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,\nv (t)  =  –ωA sin (ωt + φ )            (velocity),\na (t)  =  –ω2A cos (ωt + φ )\n= –ω2x (t)                            (acceleration),\nThus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic\nmotion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude vm=ω A  and acceleration\namplitude am =ω 2A, respectively.\n6.

    "content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. The period T is the least time after which motion repeats itself.  Thus, motion repeats\nitself after nT where n is an integer.\n2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion\ngoverned by the force law F = – k x is simple harmonic.\n3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)\nas well as due to simple har monic force in two dimensions equal to: – m\nω2r.  In the\nlatter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ\nby π/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force  – mω2r with initial position (0,\nA) and velocity ( ωA, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.\n4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given ω, two initial conditions are necessary\nand sufficient to determine the motion completely.  The  initial  conditions may be (i)\ninitial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy\nand phase.\n5. From point 4 above, given  amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the\ninitial position or initial velocity.\n6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases\nis not necessarily periodic.  It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral\nmultiple of the other’s frequency.  However, a periodic motion can always be expressed\nas a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.\n7. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant.\nContrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler’s third law).\n8. The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.\n9. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement x must be expressible\nin either of the following forms :\nx = A cos\nωt  +  B sin ωt\nx = A cos (ωt + α ), x =  B sin (ωt + β )\nThe three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any\nother two forms).\nThus, damped simple harmonic motion is not strictly simple harmonic. It is\napproximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/b where b is the damping\nconstant.\nPHYSICS274",

    "content": "14.1 INTRODUCTION\nIn the pr evious Chapter, we studied the motion of objects\noscillating in isolation. What happens in a system, which is\na collection of such objects? A material medium provides\nsuch an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents\nto each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of\nthe other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water,\nthe water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not\nremain confined to one place, but propagates outward along\na circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you\nsee circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the\nwater surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is\nmoving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put\nsome cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that\nthe cork pieces move up and down but do not move away\nfrom the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water\nmass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a\nmoving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,\nthe sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air\nfrom one part of the medium to another . The disturbances\nproduced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or\na microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move\nwithout the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a\nwhole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such\nwaves.\nWaves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has\ninformation that propagate from one point to another.

W e know that light waves can\ntravel through vacuum. The light emitted by\nstars, which are hundreds of light years away,\nreaches us through inter -stellar space, which\nis practically a vacuum.\nThe most familiar type of waves such as waves\non a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic\nwaves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves.\nThese waves require a medium for propagation,\nthey cannot propagate through vacuum. They\ninvolve oscillations of constituent particles and\ndepend on the elastic properties of the medium.\nThe electromagnetic waves that you will learn\nin Class XII are a different type of wave.\nElectromagnetic waves do not necessarily require\na medium - they can travel through vacuum.\nLight, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic\nwaves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves\nhave the same speed c, whose value is :\nc = 299, 792, 458 ms–1. (14.1)\nA third kind of wave is the so-called Matter\nwaves. They are associated with constituents of\nmatter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and\nmolecules. They arise in quantum mechanical\ndescription of nature that you will learn in your\nlater studies. Though conceptually more abstract\nthan mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they\nhave already found applications in several\ndevices basic to modern technology; matter\nwaves associated with electrons are employed\nin electron microscopes.\nIn this chapter we will study mechanical\nwaves, which require a material medium for\ntheir propagation.\nThe aesthetic influence of waves on art and\nliterature is seen from very early times; yet the\nfirst scientific analysis of wave motion dates back\nto the seventeenth century. Some of the famous\nscientists associated with the physics of wave\nmotion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695),\nRobert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The\nunderstanding of physics of waves followed the\nphysics of oscillations of masses tied to springs\nand physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in\nelastic media are intimately connected with\nharmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled\nsprings, air, etc., are examples of elastic media).\nWe shall illustrate this connection thr ough\nsimple examples.\nConsider a collection of springs connected to\none another as shown in Fig. 14.1. If the spring\nat one end is pulled suddenly and released, the\ndisturbance travels to the other end. What has\nhappened? The first spring is disturbed from its\nequilibrium length. Since the second spring is\nconnected to the first, it is also stretched or\ncompressed, and so on. The disturbance moves\nfrom one end to the other; but each spring only\nexecutes small oscillations about its equilibrium\nposition. As a practical example of this situation,\nconsider a stationary train at a railway station.\nDifferent bogies of the train are coupled to each\nother through a spring coupling. When an\nengine is attached at one end, it gives a push to\nthe bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from\none bogie to another without the entire train\nbeing bodily displaced.\nNow let us consider the propagation of sound\nwaves in air. As the wave passes through air, it\ncompresses or expands a small region of air. This\ncauses a change in the density of that region,\nsay\nδρ, this change induces a change in pressure,\nδp, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area,\nso there is a restoring force proportional to\nthe disturbance, just like in a spring. In this\ncase, the quantity similar to extension or\ncompression of the spring is the change in\ndensity. If a region is compressed, the molecules\nin that region are packed together, and they tend\nto move out to the adjoining region, thereby\nincreasing the density or creating compression\nin the adjoining region. Consequently, the air\nin the fir st region undergoes rarefaction. If a\nregion is comparatively rarefied the surrounding\nair will rush in making the rarefaction move to\nthe adjoining region. Thus, the compression or\nrarefaction moves fr om one region to another,\nmaking the propagation of a disturbance\npossible in air.\nFig. 14.1 A collection of springs connected to each\nother . The end A is pulled suddenly\ngenerating a disturbance, which then\npropagates to the other end.\nPHYSICS280\nIn solids, similar arguments can be made. In\na crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are\narranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each\natom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to\nforces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing\none atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to\nrestoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we\ncan think of atoms in a lattice as end points,\nwith springs between pairs of them.\nIn the subsequent sections of this chapter\nwe are going to discuss various characteristic\nproperties of waves.",

    "content": "14.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\nWe have seen that motion of mechanical waves\ninvolves oscillations of constituents of the\nmedium. If the constituents of the medium\noscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a transverse wave.\nIf they oscillate along the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a longitudinal\nwave.\nFig.14.2 shows the propagation of a single\npulse along a string, resulting from a single up\nand down jerk. If the string is very long compared\nposition as the pulse or wave passes through\nthem. The oscillations are normal to the\ndirection of wave motion along the string, so this\nis an example of transverse wave.\nWe can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix\nan instant of time and picture the wave in space.\nThis will give us the shape of the wave as a\nwhole in space at a given instant. Another way\nis to fix a location i.e. fix our attention on a\nparticular element of string and see its\noscillatory motion in time.\nFig. 14.4 describes the situation for\nlongitudinal waves in the most familiar example\nof the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe\nfilled with air has a piston at one end. A single\nsudden push forward and pull back of the piston\nwill generate a pulse of condensations (higher\ndensity) and rarefactions (lower density) in the\nmedium (air). If the  push-pull of the piston is\ncontinuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a\nFig. 14.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling\nalong a stretched string is an example of a\ntransverse wave. An element of the string\nin the region of the wave oscillates about\nits equilibrium position perpendicular to the\ndirection of wave propagation.\nFig. 14.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a\nstretched string (x-direction), the elements\nof the string oscillate up and down (y-\ndirection)\nto the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out\nbefore it reaches the other end and reflection\nfrom that end may be ignored. Fig. 14.3 shows a\nsimilar situation, but this time the external\nagent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up\nand down jerk to one end of the string. The\nresulting disturbance on the string is then a\nsinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of\nthe string oscillate about their equilibrium mean\nFig. 14.4 Longitudinal waves (sound) generated in a\npipe filled with air by moving the piston up\nand down. A volume element of air oscillates\nin the direction parallel to the direction of\nwave propagation.\nWAVES 281\nsinusoidal wave will be generated propagating\nin air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly\nan example of longitudinal waves.\nThe waves considered above, transverse or\nlongitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves\nsince they travel from one part of the medium\nto another. The material medium as a whole\ndoes not move, as already noted. A stream, for\nexample, constitutes motion of water as a whole.\nIn a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves,\nnot water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion\nof air as a whole) should not be confused with a\nsound wave which is a propagation of\ndisturbance (in pressure density) in air, without\nthe motion of air medium as a whole.\nIn transverse waves, the particle motion is\nnormal to the direction of propagation of the\nwave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each\nelement of the medium undergoes a shearing\nstrain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be\npropagated only in those media, which can\nsustain shearing stress, such as solids and not\nin fluids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain\ncompressive strain; therefore, longitudinal\nwaves can be propagated in all elastic media.\nFor example, in medium like steel, both\ntransverse and longitudinal waves can\npropagate, while air can sustain only\nlongitudinal waves. The waves on the surface\nof water are of two kinds: capillary waves and\ngravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly\nshort wavelength —not more than a few\ncentimetre —and the restoring force that\nproduces them is the surface tension of water.\nGravity waves have wavelengths typically\nranging from several metres to several hundred\nmeters. The restoring force that produces these\nwaves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep\nthe water surface at its lowest level. The\noscillations of the particles in these waves are\nnot confined to the surface only, but extend with\ndiminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The\nparticle motion in water waves involves a\ncomplicated motion—they not only move up and\ndown but also back and forth. The waves in an\nocean are the combination of both longitudinal\nand transverse waves.\nIt is found that, generally, transverse and\nlongitudinal waves travel with different speed\nin the same medium.\nuuu\nuu Example  14.1  Given below are some\nexamples of wave motion.

    "content": "14.3 DISPLACEMENT RELATION IN\nA  PROGRESSIVE WAVE\nFor mathematical description of  a travelling\nwave, we need a function of both position x and\ntime t. Such a function at every instant should\ngive the shape of the wave at that instant. Also,\nat every given location, it should describe the\nmotion of the constituent of the medium at that\nlocation. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal\ntravelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig.\n14.3) the corresponding function must also be\nsinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the\nwave to be transverse so that if the position of\nthe constituents of the medium is denoted by x,\nthe displacement from the equilibrium position\nmay be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling\nwave is then described by:\n( , ) sin( ) = − ω + φy x t a kx t (14.2)\nThe term φ in the argument of sine function\nmeans equivalently that we are considering a\nlinear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n( , ) sin( ) cos( )y x t A kx t B kx t ω ω= − + − (14.3)\nFrom Equations (14.2) and (14.3),\n2 2a A B= +  and  1tanφ −= B\nA\n\n \n\nTo understand why Equation (14.2)\nrepresents a sinusoidal travelling wave, take a\nfixed instant,  say t = t0. Then, the argument of\nthe sine function in Equation (14.2) is simply\nPHYSICS282\nkx + constant. Thus, the shape of the wave (at\nany fixed instant) as a function of x  is a sine\nwave. Similarly, take a fixed location, say x = x0.\nThen, the argument of the sine function in\nEquation (14.2) is constant - ωt. The\ndisplacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies\nsinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents\nof the medium at different positions execute\nsimple harmonic motion. Finally, as t increases,\nx must increase in the positive direction to keep\nkx –\nωt + φ  constant. Thus, Eq. (14.2) represents\na sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along\nthe positive direction of the x-axis. On the other\nhand, a function\n( , ) sin( ) = + ω + φy x t a kx t  (14.4)\nrepresents a wave travelling in the negative\ndirection of x-axis. Fig. (14.5) gives the names of\nthe various physical quantities appearing in Eq.\n(14.2) that we now interpret.\nFig. 1 4.6 shows the plots of Eq. (1 4.2) for\ndifferent values of time differing by equal\nintervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the\npoint of maximum positive displacement, the\ntrough is the point of maximum negative\ndisplacement. To see how a wave travels, we\ncan fix attention on a crest and see how it\nprogresses with time. In the figure, this is\nshown by a cross (×) on the crest. In the same\nmanner, we can see the motion of a particular\nconstituent of the medium at a fixed location,\nsay at the origin of the x-axis. This is shown\nby a solid dot (•) . The plots of Fig. 1 4.6 show\nthat with time, the solid dot (•) at the origin\nmoves periodically , i.e. , the particle at the\norigin oscillates about its mean position as\nthe wave progresses. This is true for any other\nlocation also. We also see that during the time\nthe solid dot (•) has completed one full\noscillation, the crest has moved further by a\ncertain distance.\nUsing the plots of Fig. 14.6, we now define\nthe various quantities of Eq. (14.2).",

It is convenient to look at the\nmotion of the crest of the wave. Fig. 14.8 gives\nthe shape of the wave at two instants of time,\nwhich differ by a small time internal ∆t. The\nentire wave pattern is seen to shift to the right\n(positive direction of x-axis) by a distance ∆x. In\nparticular, the crest shown by a dot (\n• ) moves a\ndistance ∆x in time ∆t. The speed of the wave is\nthen ∆x/∆t. We can put the dot ( • ) on a point\nwith any other phase. It will move with the same\nspeed v (otherwise the wave pattern will not\nremain fixed). The motion of a fixed phase point\non the wave is given by\nkx –\nωt = constant (14.10)\nThus, as time t changes, the position x of the\nfixed phase point must change so that the phase\nremains constant.

    "content": "14.4.1 Speed of a Transverse Wave on\nStretched String\nThe speed of a mechanical wave is determined\nby the restoring force setup in the medium when\nit is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass\ndensity) of the medium. The speed is expected to\nbe directly related to the former and inversely to\nthe latter. For waves on a string, the r estoring\nforce is provided by the tension T in the string.\nThe inertial property will in this case be linear\nmass density\nµ , which is mass m  of the string\ndivided by its length L. Using Newton’s Laws of\nMotion, an exact formula for the wave speed on\na string can be derived, but this derivation is\noutside the scope of this book. W e shall,\ntherefore, use dimensional analysis. We already\nknow that dimensional analysis alone can never\nyield the exact formula. The overall\ndimensionless constant is always left\nundetermined by dimensional analysis.\nThe dimension of\nµ  is [ML–1] and that of T is\nlike force, namely [MLT–2]. We need to combine\nthese dimensions to get the dimension of speed\nv\n[LT–1].

W e have\nalready seen that the sound waves travel in the\nform of compressions and rarefactions of small\nvolume elements of air.  The elastic property that\ndetermines the stress under compressional\nstrain is the bulk modulus of the medium defined\nby (see Chapter 8)\nPB  V/V\nΔ= − Δ (14.16)\nHere, the change in pressure ∆P produces a\nvolumetric strain\nV\nV\nΔ\n. B has the same dimension\nas pressure and given in SI units in terms of\npascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the\npropagation of wave is the mass density ρ, with\ndimensions [ML –3].

    "content": "Table 14.1 Speed of Sound in some Media\nLiquids and solids generally have higher speed\nof sound than gases. [Note for solids, the speed\nbeing referred to is the speed of longitudinal\nwaves in the solid]. This happens because they\nare much more difficult to compress than gases\nand so have much higher values of bulk modulus.\nNow, see Eq. (14.19). Solids and liquids have\nhigher mass densities (\nρ ) than gases. But the\ncorresponding increase in both the modulus (B)\nof solids and liquids is much higher. This is the\nreason why the sound waves travel faster in\nsolids and liquids.\nWe can estimate the speed of sound in a gas\nin the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas,\nthe pressure P, volume V and temperature T are\nrelated by (see Chapter 10).\nPV = NkBT (14.21)\nwhere N is the number of molecules in volume\nV, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the\ntemperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for\nan isothermal change it follows from Eq.(14.21)\nthat\nV∆P + P∆V  = 0\nor\nPV/V\nP =∆\n∆−\nHence, substituting in Eq. (14.16), we have\nB = P\nTherefore, from Eq.

I f we examin e the basic\nassumption made by Newton that the pressure\nvariations in a medium during propagation of\nsound are isothermal, we find that this is not\ncorrect. It was pointed out by Laplace that the\npressure variations in the propagation of sound\nwaves are so fast that there is little time for the\nheat flow to maintain constant temperature.\nThese variations, therefore, are adiabatic and\nnot isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal\ngas satisfies the relation (see Section 11.8),\nPV\nγ  = constant\ni.e. ∆(PV γ )  = 0\nor P γ V γ –1 ∆V + V γ ∆P = 0\nwhere γ is the ratio of two specific heats,\nCp/Cv.\nThus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk\nmodulus is given by,\nBad =\nV/V\nP ∆\n∆−\n=  γP\nThe speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq.\n(14.19), given by,\nv = ρ\nγ P  (14.24)\nThis modification of Newton’s formula is referred\nto as the Laplace  correction .

    "content": "14.5 THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION\nOF WAVES\nWhat happens when two wave pulses travelling\nin opposite directions cross each other\n(Fig. 14.9)? It turns out that wave pulses\ncontinue to retain their identities after they have\ncrossed. However, during the time they overlap,\nthe wave pattern is different from either of the\npulses. Figure 14.9 shows the situation when\ntwo pulses of equal and opposite shapes move\ntowards each other. When the pulses overlap,\nthe resultant displacement is the algebraic sum\nof the displacement due to each pulse. This is\nknown as the principle of superposition of waves.\nAccording to this principle, each pulse moves\nas if others are not present. The constituents of\nthe medium, therefore, suffer displacments due\nto both and since the displacements can be\npositive and negative, the net displacement is\nan algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 14.9 gives\ngraphs of the wave shape at different times. Note\nthe dramatic effect in the graph (c); the\ndisplacements due to the two pulses have exactly\ncancelled each other and there is zero\ndisplacement throughout.\nTo put the principle of superposition\nmathematically, let y1 (x,t) and y2 (x,t) be the\ndisplacements due to two wave disturbances in\nthe medium. If the waves arrive in a region\nsimultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net\ndisplacement y (x,t) is given by\ny\n(x, t) =  y1(x, t) +  y2(x, t) (14.25)\nIf we have two or more waves moving in the\nmedium the resultant waveform is the sum of\nwave functions of individual waves. That is, if\nthe wave functions of the moving waves are\nFig. 14.9 Two pulses having equal and opposite\ndisplacements moving in opposite\ndirections.

Their wave speed will be identical. Let us\nfurther assume that their amplitudes are equal\nand they are both travelling in the positive\ndirection of x-axis. The waves only differ in their\ninitial phase. According to Eq. (14.2), the two\nwaves are described by the functions:\ny1(x, t) = a sin (kx –\nωt) (14.27)\nand y2(x, t) =  a sin (kx – ωt + φ ) (14.28)\nThe net displacement is then, by the principle\nof superposition, given by\ny\n(x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt) + a sin (kx – ωt + φ)\n(14.29)\n( ) ( )2sin cos2 2\nkx t kx ta ω ω φ φ − + − + =      \n(14.30)\nwhere we have used the familiar trignometric\nidentity for sin sin A B + .

However, its initial\nphase angle is 2\nφ\n. The significant thing is that\nits amplitude is a function of the phase difference\nφ between the constituent two waves:\nA(φ)  =  2a cos ½φ (14.32)\nFor φ = 0, when the waves are in phase,\n( ) ( ), 2 siny x t a kx t ω= − (14.33)\ni.e., the resultant wave has amplitude 2a, the\nlargest possible value for A.

    "content": "14.6.1   Standing Waves and Normal Modes\nWe considered above reflection at one boundary.\nBut there are familiar situations (a string fixed\nat either end or an air column in a pipe with\neither end closed) in which reflection takes place\nat two or more boundaries. In a string, for\nexample, a wave travelling in one direction will\nget reflected at one end, which in turn will travel\nand get reflected from the other end. This will\ngo on until there is a steady wave pattern set\nup on the string. Such wave patterns are called\nstanding waves or stationary waves. To see this\nmathematically, consider a wave travelling\nalong the positive direction of x-axis and a\nreflected wave of the same amplitude and\nwavelength in the negative direction of x-axis.\nFrom Eqs. (14.2) and (14.4), with φ = 0, we get:\ny1(x, t) = a sin (kx –\nωt)\ny2(x, t) = a sin (kx + ωt)\nThe resultant wave on the string is, according\nto the principle of superposition:\ny\n(x, t) =  y1(x, t) + y2(x, t)\nphenomenon of echo is an example of reflection\nby a rigid boundary. If the boundary is not\ncompletely rigid or is an interface between two\ndifferent elastic media, the situation is some\nwhat complicated. A part of the incident wave is\nreflected and a part is transmitted into the\nsecond medium. If a wave is incident obliquely\non the boundary between two different media\nthe transmitted wave is called the refracted\nwave. The incident and refracted waves obey\nSnell’s law of refraction, and the incident and\nreflected waves obey the usual laws of\nreflection.\nFig. 14.11 shows a pulse travelling along a\nstretched string and being reflected by the\nboundary. Assuming there is no absorption of\nenergy by the boundary, the reflected wave has\nthe same shape as the incident pulse but it\nsuffers a phase change of π or 1800 on reflection.\nThis is because the boundary is rigid and the\ndisturbance must have zero displacement at all\ntimes at the boundary. By the principle of\nsuperposition, this is possible only if the reflected\nand incident waves differ by a phase of π, so that\nthe resultant displacement is zero. This\nreasoning is based on boundary condition on a\nrigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion\ndynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall,\nit exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third\nLaw, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force\non the string generating a reflected pulse that\ndiffers by a phase of π.\nFig. 14.11 Reflection of a pulse meeting a rigid\nboundary.\nPHYSICS290\n= a [sin (kx – ωt) + sin (kx + ωt)]\nUsing the familiar trignometric identity\nSin (A+B) + Sin (A–B) = 2 sin A cosB we get,\ny (x, t) = 2a sin kx cos ωt (14.37)\nNote the important difference in the wave\npattern described by Eq. (14.37) from that\ndescribed by Eq. (14.2) or Eq. (14.4). The terms\nkx and\nωt appear separately, not in the\ncombination kx - ωt. The amplitude of this wave\nis 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the\namplitude varies from point-to-point, but each\nelement of the string oscillates with the same\nangular frequency\nω or time period. There is no\nphase difference between oscillations of different\nelements of the wave. The string as a whole\nvibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at\ndifferent points. The wave pattern is neither\nmoving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they\nare called standing or stationary waves. The\namplitude is fixed at a given location but, as\nremarked earlier , it is dif ferent at dif ferent\nlocations. The points at which the amplitude is\nzero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are\nnodes; the points at which the amplitude is the\nlargest are called antinodes. Fig. 14.12 shows\na stationary wave pattern resulting from\nsuperposition of two travelling waves in\nopposite directions.\nThe most significant feature of stationary\nwaves is that the boundary conditions constrain\nthe possible wavelengths or frequencies of\nvibration of the system. The system cannot\noscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast\nthis with a harmonic travelling wave), but is\ncharacterised by a set of natural frequencies or\nnormal modes of oscillation. Let us determine\nthese normal modes for a stretched string fixed\nat both ends.\nFirst, from Eq. (14.37), the positions of nodes\n(where the amplitude is zero) are given by\nsin kx = 0 .\nwhich implies\nkx = n\nπ;   n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nSince, k = 2π/λ , we get\nx =\nλ\n2\nn\n; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...        (14.38)\nFig. 14.12 Stationary waves arising from superposition of two harmonic waves travelling in opposite directions.\nNote that the positions of zero displacement (nodes) remain fixed at all times.\nWAVES 291\nClearly, the distance between any two\nsuccessive nodes is\nλ\n2 . In the same way, the\npositions of antinodes (where the amplitude is\nthe largest) are given by the largest value of sin\nkx :\nsin k x = 1\nwhich implies\nkx = (n + ½)\nπ ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nWith k = 2π/λ, we get\nx = (n + ½)2\nλ  ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...                (14.39)\nAgain the distance between any two consecutive\nantinodes is 2\nλ . Eq. (14.38) can be applied to\nthe case of a stretched string of\nlength L fixed at both ends. Taking\none end to be at x = 0, the boundary\nconditions are that x = 0 and x = L\nare positions of nodes. The x = 0\ncondition is already satisfied. The\nx = L node condition requires that\nthe length L is related to λ by\nL = n\n2\nλ ;     n = 1, 2, 3, ...        (14.40)\nThus, the possible wavelengths of\nstationary waves are constrained\nby the relation\nλ  = 2L\nn\n;    n = 1, 2, 3, …   (14.41)\nwith corresponding frequencies\nv =\n2L\nnv , for  n = 1, 2, 3,   (14.42)\nWe have thus obtained the natural\nfrequencies - the normal modes of\noscillation of the system. The lowest\npossible natural frequency of a\nsystem is called its fundamental\nmode or the first harmonic. For the\nstretched string fixed at either end\nit is given by v =\nv\nL2 , corresponding\nto n = 1 of Eq. (14.42). Here v is the\nspeed of wave determined by the properties of\nthe medium. The n = 2 frequency is called the\nsecond harmonic; n = 3 is the third harmonic\nand so on. We can label the various harmonics by\nthe symbol νn ( n = 1, 2, ...).\nFig. 14.13 shows the first six harmonics of a\nstretched string fixed at either end. A string\nneed not vibrate in one of these modes only.\nGenerally, the vibration of a string will be a\nsuperposition of different modes; some modes\nmay be more strongly excited and some less.\nMusical instruments like sitar or violin are\nbased on this principle. Where the string is\nplucked or bowed, determines which modes are\nmore prominent than others.\nLet us next consider normal modes of\noscillation of an air column with one end closed\nFig. 14.13  The first six harmonics of vibrations of a stretched\nstring fixed at both ends.\nPHYSICS292\nand the other open. A glass tube partially filled\nwith water illustrates this system. The end in\ncontact with water is a node, while the open end\nis an antinode. At the node the pressure\nchanges are the largest, while the displacement\nis minimum (zero). At the open end - the\nantinode, it is just the other way - least pressure\nchange and maximum amplitude of\ndisplacement. Taking the end in contact with\nwater to be x = 0, the node condition (Eq. 14.38)\nis already satisfied. If the other end x = L is an\nantinode, Eq. (14.39) gives\nL =\nn +\n \n\n1\n2  2\nλ , for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, …\nThe possible wavelengths are then restricted by\nthe relation :\nλ  =\n( )\n2\n1 2\nL\nn  + /\n,  for n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...

If the external frequency is close to one of\nthe natural frequencies, the system shows\nresonance.\nNormal modes of a circular membrane rigidly\nclamped to the circumference as in a tabla are\ndetermined by the boundary condition that no\npoint on the circumference of the membrane\nvibrates. Estimation of the frequencies of normal\nmodes of this system is more complex. This\nproblem involves wave propagation in two\ndimensions. However, the underlying physics is\nthe same.\nu uu uu",

    "content": "14.7   BEATS\n‘Beats’ is an interesting phenomenon arising\nfrom interference of waves. When two harmonic\nsound waves of close (but not equal) frequencies\nare heard at the same time, we hear a sound of\nsimilar frequency (the average of two close\nfrequencies), but we hear something else also.\nWe hear audibly distinct waxing and waning of\nthe intensity of the sound, with a frequency\nequal to the difference in the two close\nfrequencies. Artists use this phenomenon often\nFig. 14.15 Standing waves in an open pipe, first four\nharmonics are depicted.\nPHYSICS294\nω2. Since  ω = 2πν, the beat frequency νbeat, is\ngiven by\nνbeat = ν1 – ν2 (14.48)\nFig. 14.16 illustrates the phenomenon of\nbeats for two harmonic waves of frequencies 11\nHz and 9 Hz. The amplitude of the resultant wave\nshows beats at a frequency of 2 Hz.\nu uu uu Example 14.6  Two sitar strings A and B\nplaying the note ‘ Dha’ are slightly out of\ntune and produce beats of frequency 5 Hz.\nThe tension of the string B is slightly\nincreased and the beat frequency is found\nto decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original\nfrequency of B if the frequency of A is\n427 Hz ?\nAnswer Increase in the tension of a string\nincreases its frequency. If the original frequency\nof B (\nνB) were greater than that of A (νA ), further\nincrease in νB should have resulted in an\nincrease in the beat frequency. But the beat\nfrequency is found to decrease. This shows that\nνB < νA. Since νA – νB = 5 Hz, and νA = 427 Hz, we\nget νB = 422 Hz. ⊳\nMusical Pillars\nTemples often have some pillars portraying\nhuman figures playing musical instru-\nments, but seldom do these pillars\nthemselves produce  music. At the\nNellaiappar temple in Tamil Nadu, gentle\ntaps on a cluster of pillars carved out of a\nsingle piece of rock produce the basic notes\nof Indian classical music, viz. Sa, Re, Ga,\nMa, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa. Vibrations of these\npillars depend on elasticity of the stone used,\nits density and shape.\nMusical pillars are categorised into three\ntypes: The first is called the Shruti Pillar,\nas it can produce the basic notes —  the\n“swaras”. The second type is the Gana\nThoongal, which generates the basic tunes\nthat make up the “ragas”. The third variety\nis the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce\n“taal” (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the\nNellaiappar temple are a combination of the\nShruti and Laya types.\nArchaeologists date the Nelliappar\ntemple to the 7th century and claim it was\nbuilt by successive rulers of the Pandyan\ndynasty.\nThe musical pillars of Nelliappar and\nseveral other temples in southern India like\nthose at Hampi (picture), Kanyakumari, and\nThiruvananthapuram are unique to the\ncountry and have no parallel in any other\npart of the world.\nFig. 14.16 Superposition of two harmonic waves, one\nof frequency 11 Hz (a), and the other of\nfrequency 9Hz (b), giving rise to beats of\nfrequency 2 Hz, as shown in (c).\nWAVES 295",

    "content": "SUMMARY\n1. Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.\n2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular\nto the direction of wave propagation.\n3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves fr om one point of medium to another .\n5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given\nby\ny (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)\nwhere a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular\nfrequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.\n6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of\nthe same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between\ntwo  consecutive nodes or antinodes.\n7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium\ntakes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω\nthrough the relation\nT = 2π\nω\n8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by\n2\nων = π\n9. Speed of a progressive wave is given by\nk Tv ω λ λν= = =\n10.  The speed of a transverse wave  on a stretched string is set by the properties of the\nstring. The speed on a string with tension T and linear mass density µ  is\nv = T\nµ\n11. Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves that can travel through solids, liquids,\nor gases. The speed v of sound wave in a fluid having bulk modulus B and density ρ is\nv B=\nρ\nThe speed of longitudinal waves in a metallic bar is\nv Y=\nρ\nFor  gases,  since B = γP, the speed of sound is\nv P= γ\nρ\nPHYSICS296\n12. When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the\ndisplacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements\ndue to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves\n1\n(   )\nn\ni\ni\ny f x vt\n=\n= −∑\n13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling\naccording to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same\ndirection and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase\nconstant\nφ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :\ny     (x, t)  = 2 1\n2\n1\n2a kxcos sinφ ω φ\n\n\n − +\n \n t\nIf φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference\nis constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.\n14. A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase\nreversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.\nFor an incident wave\nyi (x, t) = a sin (kx –\nωt )\nthe reflected wave at a rigid boundary is\nyr (x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )\nFor reflection at an open boundary\nyr (x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)\n15. The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing\nwaves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by\ny (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt\nStanding waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes\nand fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation\nbetween two consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.\nA stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by\nv  ,2= n v\nL\nn = 1, 2, 3, ...\nThe set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of\noscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the\nfundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode\nwith n = 2 and so on.\nA pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)\nvibrates with frequencies given by\nv ( )n ½  2L\nv= + ,       n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nThe set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the normal modes of\noscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/4L is the fundamental\nmode or the first harmonic.\n16. A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open\nat the other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called\ntheir normal modes. Each of these frequencies is a resonant frequency of the system.\n17. Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies,\nν1 and ν2 and\ncomparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is\nνbeat = ν1 ~ ν2\nWAVES 297",

The former involves motion of air from one place to the other.  The\nlatter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.\n2. In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other .\n3. In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through\nelastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.\n4.

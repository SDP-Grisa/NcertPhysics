Thus, the result of\nmeasurement should be reported in a way that\nindicates the precision of measurement.\nNormally, the reported result of measurement\nis a number that includes all digits in the\nnumber that are known reliably plus the first\ndigit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus\nthe first uncertain digit are known as\nsignificant\ndigits or significant figures. If we\nsay the period of oscillation of a simple\npendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are\nreliable and certain, while the digit 2 is\nuncertain. Thus, the measured value has three\nsignificant figures. The length of an object\nreported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has\nfour significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are\ncertain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,\nreporting the result of measurement that\nincludes more digits than the significant digits\nis superfluous and also misleading since it\nwould give a wrong idea about the precision of\nmeasurement.\nThe rules for determining the number of\nsignificant figures can be understood from the\nfollowing examples. Significant figures\nindicate, as already mentioned, the precision\nof measurement which depends on the least\ncount of the measuring instrument. A choice\nof change of different units does not\nchange the number of significant digits or\nfigures in a measurement.  This important\nremark makes most of the following\nobservations clear:\n(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four\nsignificant figures. But in different units, the\nsame value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08\nmm or 23080 µm.\nAll these numbers have the same number of\nsignificant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.\nPHYSICS4\nThis shows that the location of decimal point is\nof no consequence in determining the number\nof significant figures.\nThe example gives the following rules :\n• All the non-zero digits are significant.\n• All the zeros between two non-zero digits\nare significant, no matter where the\ndecimal point is, if at all.\n• If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)\non the right of decimal point but to the\nleft of the first non-zero digit are not\nsignificant. [In\n0.00 2308, the underlined\nzeroes are not significant].\n• The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber without a decimal point are not\nsignificant.\n[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has\nthree significant figures, the trailing zero(s)\nbeing not significant.] However, you can also\nsee the next observation.\n• The trailing zero(s) in a number with a\ndecimal point are significant.\n[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four\nsignificant figures each.]\n(2) There can be some confusion regarding the\ntrailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to\nbe 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here\nare meant to convey the precision of\nmeasurement and are, therefore, significant. [If\nthese were not, it would be superfluous to write\nthem explicitly, the reported measurement\nwould have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose\nwe change units, then\n4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km\nSince the last number has trailing zero(s) in a\nnumber with no decimal, we would conclude\nerroneously from observation (1) above that the\nnumber has  two  significant figures, while in\nfact, it has four significant figures and a mere\nchange of units cannot change the number of\nsignificant figures.\n(3) To remove such ambiguities in\ndetermining the number of significant\nfigures, the best way is to report every\nmeasurement in scientific notation (in the\npower of 10). In this notation, every number is\nexpressed as a × 10 b, where a is a number\nbetween 1 and 10, and b is any positive or\nnegative exponent (or power) of 10.  In order to\nget an approximate idea of the number, we may\nround off the number a to 1 (for a\n≤ 5) and to 10\n(for 5< a ≤ 10). Then the number can be\nexpressed approximately as 10 b in which the\nexponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of\nmagnitude of the physical quantity. When only\nan estimate is required, the quantity is of the\norder of 10 b. For example, the diameter of the\nearth (1.28×107m) is of the order of 10 7m with\nthe order of magnitude 7. The diameter of\nhydrogen atom (1.06 ×10–10m) is of the order of\n10 –10m, with the order of magnitude\n–10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders\nof magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.\nIt is often customary to write the decimal after\nthe first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in\n(a) above disappears :\n4.700 m = 4.700 × 102 cm\n= 4.700 × 103 mm = 4.700 × 10–3 km\nThe power of 10 is irrelevant to the\ndetermination of significant figures. However, all\nzeroes appearing in the base number in the\nscientific notation are significant. Each number\nin this case has four significant figures.\nThus, in the scientific notation, no confusion\narises about the trailing zero(s) in the base\nnumber a. They are always significant.\n(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting\nmeasurement. But if this is not adopted, we use\nthe rules adopted in the preceding example :\n• For a number greater than 1, without any\ndecimal, the trailing zero(s) are not\nsignificant.\n• For a number with a decimal, the trailing\nzero(s) are significant.\n(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a\ndecimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)\nis never significant. However, the zeroes at the\nend of such number are significant in a\nmeasurement.\n(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are\nneither rounded numbers nor numbers\nrepresenting measured values are exact and\nhave infinite number of significant digits. For\nexample in\n2\ndr =  or  s = 2πr, the factor 2 is an\nexact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00\nUNITS AND MEASUREMENT 5\nor 2.0000 as required.

It cannot be more accurate\nthan the original measured values themselves\non which the result is based. In general, the\nfinal result should not have more significant\nfigures than the original data from which it was\nobtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured\nto be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and\nits volume is measured to be 2.51 cm3, then its\ndensity, by mere arithmetic division, is\n1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal places.\nIt would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to\nrecord the calculated value of density to such a\nprecision when the measurements on which the\nvalue is based, have much less precision. The\nfollowing rules for arithmetic operations with\nsignificant figures ensure that the final result\nof a calculation is shown with the precision that\nis consistent with the precision of the input\nmeasured values :\n(1)  In multiplication or division, the final\nresult should retain as many significant\nfigures as are there in the original number\nwith the least significant figures.\nThus, in the example above, density should\nbe reported to three significant figures.\nDensity\n4.237g\n2.51 cm\n1.69 g cm3\n-3= =\nSimilarly,  if the speed of light is given as\n3.00 × 108 m s -1 (three significant figure) and\none year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 × 107 s (five\nsignificant figures), the light year is 9.47 × 1015 m\n(three significant figures).\n(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result\nshould retain as many decimal places as are\nthere in the number with the least\ndecimal places.\nFor example, the sum of th e numbers\n436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic\naddition,  is 663.821 g. But the least precise\nmeasurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one\ndecimal place. The final result should, therefore,\nbe rounded off to 663.8 g.\nSimilarly, the difference in length can be\nexpressed as :\n0.307 m – 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 ×10–3 m.\nNote that we should not use the rule (1) applicable\nfor multiplication and division and write 664 g as\nthe result in the example of addition  and\n3.00 × 10–3 m in the example of subtraction.

A\nnumber 2.74\n6 rounded off to three significant\nfigures is 2.75, while the number 1.743 would\nbe 1.74.  The rule by convention is that the\npreceding digit is raised by 1 if the\ninsignificant digit to be dropped (the\nunderlined digit in this case)  is more than\n5, and is left  unchanged if the latter is less\nthan 5 .  But what if the number is 2.74\n5 in\nwhich the insignificant digit is 5.  Here, the\nconvention is that if the preceding digit is\neven, the insignificant digit is simply\ndropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit\nis raised by 1.

However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044\nand then taken the reciprocal to three significant\nfigures, we would have retrieved the original\nvalue of 9.58.\nThis example justifies the idea to retain one\nmore extra digit (than the number of digits in\nthe least precise measurement) in intermediate\nsteps of the complex multi-step calculations in\norder to avoid additional errors in the process\nof rounding off the numbers.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "1", "chapter_title": "Units and Measurement", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "1.3.3", "title": "Rules for Determining the Uncertainty", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 7, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "subsection_id": "1.3.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "1.4  DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES\nThe nature of a physical quantity is described\nby its dimensions.

Thus, length has the\ndimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current\n[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous\nintensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].\nThe dimensions of a physical quantity are the\npowers (or exponents) to which the base\nquantities are raised to represent that\nquantity. Note that using the square brackets\n[  ] round a quantity means that we are dealing\nwith ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.\nIn mechanics, all the physical quantities can\nbe written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]\nand [T]. For example, the volume occupied by\nan object is expressed as the product of length,\nbreadth and height, or three lengths.

If the dimensions of all the terms\nare not same, the equation is wrong.  Hence, if\nwe derive an expression for the length (or\ndistance) of an object, regardless of the symbols\nappearing in the original mathematical relation,\nwhen all the individual dimensions are\nsimplified, the remaining dimension must be\nthat of length.  Similarly, if we derive an equation\nof speed, the dimensions on both the sides of\nequation, when simplified, must be of length/\ntime, or [L T–1].\nDimensions are customarily used as a\npreliminary test of the consistency of an\nequation, when there is some doubt about the\ncorr ectness of the equation. However , the\ndimensional consistency does not guarantee\ncorrect equations. It is uncertain to the extent\nof dimensionless quantities or functions.

Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities.  Certain\nphysical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as\nlength, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,\nand luminous intensity).\n2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly\nstandardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,\nkelvin, mole and candela).  The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called\nfundamental or base units.\n3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a\ncombination of the base units and are called derived units.  A complete set of units,\nboth fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.\n4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present\ninternationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.\n5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and\nthe derived quantities obtained from them.  Certain derived units are expressed by\nmeans of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).\n6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m\nfor metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).\n7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific\nnotation, with powers of 10.  Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify\nmeasurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision\nof the numbers.\n8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical\nquantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for\nexpressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.\n9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the\nrelationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired\nunits are obtained.\n10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.\nRules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic\noperations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.\n11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe\nthe nature of physical quantities.

The earth rotates once every twenty-four\nhours and revolves round the sun once in a year . The sun\nitself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving\nwithin its local group of galaxies.\nMotion is change in position of an object with time. How\ndoes the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall\nlearn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the\nconcepts of velocity and acceleration. W e shall confine\nourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight\nline, also known as rectilinear motion . For the case of\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple\nequations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative\nnature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.\nIn our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as\npoint objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size\nof the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a\nreasonable duration of time.  In a good number of situations\nin real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can\nbe considered as point-like objects without much error.\nIn Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without\ngoing into the causes of motion.

For this,\nwe define  instantaneous velocity  or simply\nvelocity v at an instant t.\nThe velocity at an instant is defined as the\nlimit of the average velocity as the time interval\n∆t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,\nv lim\nx\nt\n=\nt  0∆\n∆\n∆→\n(2.1a)\n=\nd\nd\nx\nt\n(2.1b)\nwhere the symbol lim\nt 0∆ →  stands for the operation\nof taking limit as  ∆tg0 of the quantity on its\nright. In the language of calculus, the quantity\non the right hand side of Eq. (2.1a) is the\ndifferential coefficient of x with respect to t and\nis denoted by\nd\nd\nx\nt\n(see Appendix 2.1).  It is the\nrate of change of position with respect to time,\nat that instant.\nWe can use Eq. (2.1a) for obtaining the\nvalue of velocity at an instant either\ngraphically  or numerically . Suppose that we\nwant to obtain graphically the value of\nvelocity at time  t = 4 s  (point P) for the motion\nof the car represented in Fig.2.1 calculation.\nLet us take ∆t = 2 s centred at t = 4 s. Then,\nby the definition of the average velocity, the\nslope of line P 1P2  ( Fig. 2.1) gives the value of\naverage velocity over the interval   3 s to 5 s.\nFig. 2.1 Determining velocity from position-time\ngraph.  Velocity at t = 4 s is the slope of the\ntangent to the graph at that instant.\nNow, we decrease the value of ∆t from 2 s to 1\ns.  Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2   and its slope\ngives the value of the average velocity over\nthe interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit ∆t → 0,\nthe line P1P2 becomes tangent to the position-\ntime curve at the point P and the velocity at t\n= 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at\nthat point. It is difficult to show this\nprocess graphically. But if we use\nnumerical method to obtain the value of\nthe velocity, the  meaning of the limiting\nprocess becomes clear. For the graph shown\nin Fig. 2. 1, x = 0.08 t3.  Table 2.1 gives the\nvalue of ∆x/∆t calculated for ∆t equal to 2.0 s,\n1.0 s, 0.5 s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t =\n4.0 s.

In this\nmanner, we can calculate velocity at each\ninstant for motion of the car.\nThe graphical method for the determination\nof the instantaneous velocity is always not a\nconvenient method.  For this, we must carefully\nplot the position–time graph and calculate the\nvalue of average velocity as ∆t becomes smaller\nand smaller.  It is easier to calculate the value\nof velocity at different instants if we have data\nof positions at different instants or exact\nexpression for the position as a function of time.\nThen, we calculate ∆x/∆t from the data for\ndecreasing the value of ∆t and find the limiting\nvalue as we have done in Table 2.1 or use\ndifferential calculus for the given expression and\ncalculate\ndx\ndt  at different instants as done in\nthe following example.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "2", "chapter_title": "Motion in a Straight Line", "type": "section", "identifier": "2.2", "title": "INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED", "page_start": 2, "page_end": 3, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["2.1"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "2.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Example 2.1    The position of an object\nmoving along x-axis is given by   x = a + bt2\nwhere  a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m s–2 and t is\nmeasured in seconds.

How to describe\nthis change? Should it be described as the rate\nof change in velocity with distance or with\ntime\n?   This was a problem even in Galileo’s\ntime. It was first thought that this change could\nbe described by the rate of change of velocity\nwith distance. But, through his studies of\nmotion of freely falling objects and motion of\nobjects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded\nthat the rate of change of velocity with time is\na constant of motion for all objects in free fall.\nOn the other hand, the change in velocity with\ndistance is not constant – it decreases with the\nincreasing distance of fall . This led to the\nconcept of acceleration as the rate of change\nof velocity with time.\nThe average acceleration\na  over a time interval\nis defined as the change of velocity divided by\nthe time interval :\n2 1\n2 1\n–\n–\nv v va\nt t t\n∆= = ∆\n(2.2)\nwhere v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities\nor simply velocities at time  t2\nand t1\n.

Between times 0 to\nt1, it moves in  positive x - direction\nand between t 1 and t 2 it moves in the\nopposite direction.\nInstantaneous acceleration is defined in the\nsame way as the instantaneous velocity :\nd\ndt 0\nv va lim t tΔ →\nΔ= = Δ (2.3)\nThe acceleration at an instant is the slope\nof the tangent to the v–t  curve at that\ninstant.\nSince velocity is a quantity having both\nmagnitude and direction, a change in\nvelocity may involve either or both of these\nfactors.  Acceleration, therefore, may result\nfrom a change in speed (magnitude), a\nchange in direction or changes in both.  Like\nvelocity, acceleration can also be positive,\nnegative or zero.  Position-time graphs for\nmotion with positive, negative and zero\nacceleration are shown in Figs. 2. 4 (a), (b)\nand (c), respectively.  Note that the graph\ncurves upward for positive acceleration;\ndownward for negative acceleration and it is\na straight line for zero acceleration.\nAlthough acceleration can vary with time,\nour study in this chapter will be restricted\nto motion with constant acceleration. In this\ncase, the average acceleration equals the\nconstant value of acceleration during the\ninterval.

Therefore, area = u × T = uT which\nis the displacement in this time interval.  How\ncome in this case an area is equal to a distance?\nThink!  Note the dimensions of quantities on\nthe two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at\nthe answer.\nNote that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown\nin several figures in this chapter have sharp\nkinks at some points implying that the\nfunctions are not differentiable at these\npoints.

The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify\nthis choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.\n2. If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is\ndecreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity.  This\nstatement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.\n3. The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or\ndecreasing.  The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice\nof the positive direction of the axis.  For example, if the vertically upward direction is\nchosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is\nnegative.  If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,\nresults in increase in speed.  For a particle thrown upward, the same negative\nacceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.\n4. The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration\nat that instant.  A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.\nFor example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the\nacceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.\n5. In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic,\ni.e. they may be positive or negative.  The equations are applicable in all situations\n(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different\nquantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.\n6.

We shall now\ndescribe this law of addition using the graphical\nmethod. Let us consider two vectors A and B that\nlie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a).  The lengths\nof the line segments representing these vectors\nare proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.\nTo find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that\nits tail is at the head of the vector A, as in\nFig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head\nof B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is,\nthe sum of the vectors A and B.

The two vectors\nand their resultant form three sides of a triangle,\nso this method is also known as triangle method\nof vector addition. If we find the resultant of\nB + A as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector R is\nobtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative:\nA + B = B + A (3.1)\nThe addition of vectors also obeys the associative\nlaw as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of\nadding vectors A and B first and then adding\nvector C is the same as the result of adding B\nand C first and then adding vector A :\n(A + B) + C = A + (B + C) (3.2)\nWhat is the result of adding two equal and\nopposite vectors ? Consider  two  vectors A and\n–A shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is A + (–A).\nSince the magnitudes of the two vectors are the\nsame, but the directions are opposite, the\nresultant vector has zero magnitude and is\nrepresented by 0 called a null vector or a zero\nvector :\nA – A = 0         |0|= 0 (3.3)\nSince the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its\ndirection cannot be specified.\nThe null vector also results when we multiply\na vector A by the number zero. The main\nproperties of 0 are :\nA + 0 = A\nλ 0 = 0\n0 A = 0        (3.4)\nFig. 3.5 (a) Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B\nfrom vector A – the result is R2. For\ncomparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R1 is also shown.\nWhat is the physical meaning of a zero vector?\nConsider the position and displacement vectors\nin a plane as shown in Fig. 3.1(a). Now suppose\nthat an object which is at P at time t, moves to\nP′ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its\ndisplacement? Since the initial and final\npositions coincide, the displacement is a “null\nvector”.\nSubtraction of vectors can be defined in terms\nof addition of vectors. We define the difference\nof two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors\nA and –B :\nA – B = A + (–B) (3.5)\nIt is shown in Fig 3.5. The vector –B is added to\nvector A to get R2 = (A – B). The vector R1 = A + B\nis also shown in the same figure for comparison.\nWe can also use the parallelogram method to\nfind the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have\ntwo vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we\nbring their tails to a common origin O as\nshown in Fig. 3.6(a). Then we draw a line from\nthe head of A parallel to B and another line from\nthe head of B parallel to A to complete a\nparallelogram OQSP.  Now we join the point of\nthe intersection of these two lines to the origin\nO. The resultant vector R is directed from the\ncommon origin O along  the diagonal (OS) of the\nparallelogram  [ Fig. 3.6 (b)]. In Fig.3.6 (c), the\ntriangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A\nand B and we see that the two methods yield the\nsame result.

Using this method one can resolve\na given vector into two component vectors along\na set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same\nplane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector\nalong the axes of a rectangular coordinate\nsystem using vectors of unit magnitude. These\nare called unit vectors  that we discuss now. A\nunit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and\npoints in a particular direction. It has no\ndimension and unit. It is used to specify a\ndirection only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and\nz-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are\ndenoted by\nɵi, ɵj and ˆk , respectively, as shown\nin Fig. 3.9(a).\nSince these are unit vectors, we have\n\nˆi   = ˆj =  ˆk=1 (3.9)\nThese unit vectors are perpendicular to each\nother. In this text, they are printed in bold face\nwith a cap (^) to distinguish them from other\nvectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two\ndimensions in this chapter , we require use of\nonly two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector,\nsay\nˆn by a scalar, the result is a vector\nλ λλ λλ = λ ˆn.  In general, a vector A can be written as\nA = |A| ˆn (3.10)\nwhere ˆn is a unit vector along A.\nWe can now resolve a vector A in terms\nof component vectors that lie along unit vectors\niˆ and ɵj.  Consider a vector A that lies in x-y\nplane as shown in Fig. 3.9(b). We draw lines from\nthe head of A perpendicular to the coordinate\naxes as in Fig. 3.9(b), and get vectors A1 and A2\nsuch that  A1 + A2 = A. Since A1 is parallel to  ɵi\nand A2 is parallel to ɵj,  we have :\nA1= Ax ɵi,  A2 = Ay\nɵj (3.11)\nwhere Ax  and  Ay are real numbers.\nThus,    A = Ax\nɵi+ Ay ɵj              (3.12)\nThis is represented in Fig. 3.9(c).

Using simple\ntrigonometry, we can express Ax   and Ay in terms\nof the magnitude of A and the angle θ it makes\nwith the x-axis :\nAx  = A cos θ\nAy = A sin θ (3.13)\nAs is clear from Eq.

A\nthorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was\nfirst published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist\nChristiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was\nprobably known to Newton also some years earlier.\n“Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means\n‘centre-seeking’.  Since v and R are constant, the\nmagnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also\nconstant. However , the dir ection changes —\npointing always towards the centre.  Therefore, a\ncentripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.\nWe have another way of describing the\nvelocity and the acceleration of an object  in\nuniform circular motion.

Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only.  Examples are distance, speed,\nmass and  temperature.\n2. Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and dir ection both.

W e saw that\nuniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas\nnon-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in\naddition.  So far, we have not asked the question as to what\ngoverns the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this\nbasic question.\nLet us first guess the answer based on our common\nexperience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.\nTo throw a stone upwards, one has to  give it an upward\npush.  A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a\nstrong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a\nflowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external\nagency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.\nLikewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop\nmotion.  You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by\napplying a force against the direction of its motion.\nIn these examples, the external agency of force (hands,\nwind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not\nalways necessary. A stone released from the top of a building\naccelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the\nearth.  A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.\nThis shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and\nmagnetic forces )  can exert  force on a body even from a\ndistance.\nIn short, a force is required to put a stationary body in\nmotion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is\nneeded to provide this force. The external agency may or may\nnot be in contact with the body.\nSo far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.\na skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal\nice slab) ?  Is an external force required to keep a body in\nuniform motion?\n4.1 Introduction\n4.2 Aristotle’s fallacy\n4.3 The law of inertia\n4.4 Newton’s first law of motion\n4.5 Newton’s second law of\nmotion\n4.6 Newton’s third law of motion\n4.7 Conservation of momentum\n4.8 Equilibrium of a particle\n4.9 Common forces in mechanics\n4.10 Circular motion\n4.11 Solving problems in\nmechanics", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "4", "chapter_title": "Laws of Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "4.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "4.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "4.2  ARISTOTLE’S  FALLACY\nThe question posed above appears to be simple.\nHowever, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the\ncorrect answer to this question given by Galileo\nin the seventeenth century was the foundation\nof Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the\nbirth of modern science.\nThe Greek thinker,  Aristotle (384 B.C– 322\nB.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,\nsomething external is required to keep it moving.\nAccording to this view, for example, an arrow\nshot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind\nthe arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of\nan elaborate framework of ideas developed by\nAristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.\nMost of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now\nknown to be wrong and need not concern us.\nFor our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of\nmotion may be phrased thus: An external force\nis required  to keep a body in motion.\nAristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall\nsee.  However, it is a natural view that anyone\nwould hold from common experience. Even a\nsmall child playing with a simple (non-electric)\ntoy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs\nto constantly drag the string attached to the toy-\ncar with some force to keep it going.  If it releases\nthe string, it comes to rest. This experience is\ncommon to most terrestrial motion. External\nforces seem to be needed to keep bodies in\nmotion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually\ncome to rest.\nWhat is the flaw in Aristotle’s argument? The\nanswer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because\nthe external force of friction on the car by the floor\nopposes its motion. To counter this force, the child\nhas to apply an external force on the car in the\ndirection of motion.  When the car is in uniform\nmotion, there is no net external force acting on it:\nthe force by the child cancels the force ( friction)\nby the floor.  The corollary is: if there were no friction,\nthe child would not be required to apply any force\nto keep the toy car in uniform motion.\nThe opposing forces such as friction (solids)\nand viscous forces (for fluids) are always present\nin the natural world.  This explains why forces\nby external agencies are necessary to overcome\nthe frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform\nmotion. Now we understand  where Aristotle\nwent wrong.  He coded this practical experience\nin the form of a basic argument.  To get at the\ntrue law of nature for forces and motion, one has\nto imagine a world in which uniform motion is\npossible with no frictional forces opposing. This\nis what Galileo did.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "4", "chapter_title": "Laws of Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "4.2", "title": "ARISTOTLE’S  FALLACY", "page_start": 2, "page_end": 2, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "4.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "4.3  THE LAW OF INERTIA\nGalileo studied motion of objects on an inclined\nplane.  Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane\naccelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.\n(iii) Motion on a horizontal plane  is an interme-\ndiate situation.  Galileo concluded that an object\nmoving on a frictionless horizontal plane must\nneither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it\nshould move with constant velocity (Fig. 4.1(a)).\n(i) (ii) (iii)\nFig. 4.1(a)\nAnother experiment by Galileo leading to the\nsame conclusion involves a double inclined plane.\nA ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls\ndown and climbs up the other. If the planes are\nsmooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the\nsame as the initial height (a little less but never\ngreater). In the ideal situation, when friction is\nabsent, the final height of the ball is the same\nas its initial height.\nIf the slope of the second plane is decreased\nand the experiment repeated, the ball will still\nreach the same height, but in doing so , it will\ntravel a longer distance.  In the limiting case, when\nthe slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a\nhorizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.\nIn other words, its motion never ceases. This is,\nof course, an idealised situation (Fig. 4.1(b)).\nFig. 4.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo\nfrom observations of motion of a ball on a\ndouble inclined plane.\nLAWS OF MOTION 51\nIn practice, the ball does come to a stop after\nmoving a finite distance on the horizontal plane,\nbecause of the opposing force of friction which\ncan never be totally eliminated.  However, if there\nwere no friction, the ball would continue  to move\nwith a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.\nGalileo thus, arrived at a new insight on\nmotion that had eluded Aristotle and those who\nfollowed him.  The state of rest and the state of\nuniform linear motion (motion with constant\nvelocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is\nno net force acting on the body.  It is incorrect to\nassume that a net force is needed to keep a body\nin uniform motion. To maintain a body in\nuniform motion, we need to apply an external\nforce to ecounter the frictional force, so that\nthe two forces sum up to zero net external\nforce.\nTo summarise, if the net external force is zero,\na body at rest continues to remain at rest and a\nbody in motion continues to move with a uniform\nvelocity.  This property of the body is called\ninertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to  change’.\nA body does not change its state of rest or\nuniform motion, unless an external force\ncompels it to change that state.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "4", "chapter_title": "Laws of Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "4.3", "title": "THE LAW OF INERTIA", "page_start": 2, "page_end": 3, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["4.1"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "4.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "4.4  NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION\nGalileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas\ndethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new\nmechanics had to be developed. This task was\nIdeas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science\nAncient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of\nmotion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force\nof wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent\ntendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;\ntransmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps\ncomes closest to the concept of inertia.  Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to\nbe opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air\nresistance.  It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational\nand vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent\nparticles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational\nand vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a\ndefinite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of\nmotion and units of length and time.  It was known that the position of a particle in space can be\nindicated by distance measured along three axes.  Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept\nof ‘instantaneous motion’ ( tatkaliki gati ), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous\nvelocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly\nunderstood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results\nfrom the transmission of vibrations of water particles.\naccomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac\nNewton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.\nNewton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the\nfoundation of mechanics in terms of three laws\nof  motion that go by his name.  Galileo’s law of\ninertia was his starting point which he formu-\nlated as the first law of motion:\nEvery body continues to be in its state\nof rest or of uniform motion in a straight\nline unless compelled by some external\nforce to act otherwise.\nThe state of rest or uniform linear motion both\nimply zero acceleration. The first law of motion  can,\ntherefore, be simply expressed as:\nIf the net external force on a body is zero, its\nacceleration is zero.  Acceleration can be non\nzero only if there is a net external force on\nthe body.\nTwo kinds of situations are encountered in the\napplication of this law in practice. In some\nexamples, we know that the net external force\non the object is zero. In that case we can\nconclude that the acceleration of the object is\nzero.  For example, a spaceship out in\ninterstellar space, far from all other objects and\nwith all its rockets turned off, has no net\nexternal force acting on it.  Its acceleration,\naccording to the first law, must be zero.  If it is\nin motion, it must continue to move with a\nuniform velocity.\nPHYSICS52\n⊳\nMore often, however, we do not know all the\nforces to begin with.  In that case, if we know\nthat an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either\nat rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer\nfrom the first law that the net external force on\nthe object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere.\nFor terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every\nobject experiences gravitational force due to the\nearth.  Also objects in motion generally experience\nfriction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an\nobject is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is\nnot because there are no forces acting on it, but\nbecause the various external forces cancel out\ni.e. add up to zero net external force.\nConsider a book at rest on a horizontal surface\nFig. (4.2(a)).  It is subject to two external forces :\nthe force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting\ndownward and the upward force on the book by\nthe table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting\nforce. This is an example of the kind of situation\nmentioned above. The forces are not quite known\nfully but the state of motion is known. We observe\nthe book to be at rest.  Therefore, we conclude\nfrom the first law that the magnitude of R equals\nthat of W. A statement often encounter ed is :\n“Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book\nis at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct\nstatement is : “Since the book is observed to be at\nrest, the net external force on it must be zero,\naccording to the first law. This implies that the\nnormal force R  must be equal and opposite to the\nweight W ”.\nFig. 4.2 (a) a book at rest on the table, and (b) a car\nmoving with uniform velocity. The net force\nis zero in each case.\nConsider the motion of a car starting from\nrest, picking up speed and then moving on a\nsmooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig.\n(4.2(b)).  When the car is stationary, there is no\nnet force acting on it. During pick-up, it\naccelerates. This must happen due to a net\nexternal force. Note, it has to be an external force.\nThe acceleration of the car cannot be accounted\nfor by any internal force.  This might sound\nsurprising, but it is true.  The only conceivable\nexternal force along the road is the force of\nfriction.  It is the frictional force that accelerates\nthe car as a whole.  (You will learn about friction\nin section 4.9).  When the car moves with\nconstant velocity, there is no net external force.\nThe property of inertia contained in the First\nlaw is evident in many situations.  Suppose we\nare standing in a stationary  bus and the driver\nstarts the bus suddenly. W e get thr own\nbackward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch\nwith the floor. If there were no friction, we would\nremain where we were, while the floor of the bus\nwould simply slip forward under our feet and the\nback of the bus would hit us.  However ,\nfortunately, there is some friction between the\nfeet and the floor.  If the start is not too sudden,\ni.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional\nforce would be enough to accelerate our feet\nalong with the bus.  But our body is not strictly\na rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some\nrelative displacement between different parts.\nWhat this means is that while our feet go with\nthe bus, the rest of the body remains where it is\ndue to inertia.  Relative to the bus, therefore, we\nare thrown backward.  As soon as that happens,\nhowever, the muscular forces on the rest of the\nbody (by the feet) come into play to move the body\nalong with the bus. A similar thing happens\nwhen the bus suddenly stops.  Our feet stop due\nto the friction which does not allow relative\nmotion between the feet and the floor of the bus.\nBut the rest of the body continues to move\nforward due to inertia.  We are thrown forward.\nThe restoring muscular forces again come into\nplay and bring the body to rest.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "4", "chapter_title": "Laws of Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "4.4", "title": "NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION", "page_start": 3, "page_end": 4, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["4.2"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "4.4", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Example 4.1  An astronaut accidentally\ngets separated out of his small spaceship\naccelerating in inter stellar space at a\nconstant rate of 100 m s –2.

The novice, on the other hand,\nkeeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the\nball almost instantly. He needs to provide a\nmuch greater force to stop the ball instantly,\nand this hurts.  The conclusion is clear: force\nnot only depends on the change in momentum,\nbut also on how fast the change is brought\nabout.

The second\nlaw of motion refers to the general situation when\nthere is a net external force acting on the body.\nIt relates the net external force to the\nacceleration of the body.\nMomentum\nMomentum of a body is defined to be the product\nof its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted\nby p:\np = m v         (4.1)\nMomentum is clearly a vector quantity.  The\nfollowing common experiences indicate the\nimportance of this quantity for considering the\neffect of force on motion.\n• Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small\ncar) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded\ntruck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all\nknow that a much greater force is needed to\npush the truck than the car to bring them to\nthe same speed in same time.  Similarly, a\ngreater opposing force is needed to stop a\nheavy body than a light body in the same time,\nif they are moving with the same speed.\n• If two stones, one light and the other heavy,\nare dropped from the top of a building, a\nperson on the ground will find it easier to catch\nthe light stone than the heavy stone.  The\nmass of a body is thus an important\nparameter that determines the effect of force\non its motion.\n• Speed is another important parameter to\nconsider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily\npierce human tissue before it stops, resulting\nin casualty.  The same bullet fired with\nmoderate speed will not cause much damage.\nThus for a given mass, the greater the speed,\nthe greater is the opposing force needed to stop\nthe body in a certain time.  T aken together,\nthe product of mass and velocity, that is\nmomentum, is evidently a relevant variable\nof motion. The greater the change in the\nmomentum in a given time, the greater is the\nforce that needs to be applied.\n• A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball\ncoming in with great speed far more easily\nthan a novice, who can hurt his hands in the\nPHYSICS54\ncharacter of momentum has not been evident.\nIn the examples so far, momentum and change\nin momentum both have the same direction.\nBut this is not always the case.  Suppose a\nstone is rotated with uniform speed in a\nhorizontal plane by means of a string, the\nmagnitude of momentum is fixed, but its\ndirection changes (Fig. 4.4). A force is needed\nto cause this change in momentum vector .\nThis force is provided by our hand through\nthe string.  Experience suggests that our hand\nneeds to exert a greater force if the stone is\nrotated at greater speed or in a circle of\nsmaller radius, or both. This corresponds to\ngreater acceleration or equivalently a greater\nrate of change in momentum vector . This\nsuggests that the greater the rate of change\nin momentum vector the greater is the force\napplied.\nFig. 4.4 Force is necessary  for changing the direction\nof momentum, even if its magnitude is\nconstant. We can feel this while r otating a\nstone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed\nby means of a string.\nThese qualitative observations lead to the\nsecond law of motion expressed by Newton as\nfollows :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is\ndirectly proportional to the applied force and\ntakes place in the direction in which the force\nacts.\nThus, if under the action of a force F for time\ninterval ∆t, the velocity of a body of mass m\nchanges from v to v + ∆v i.e. its initial momentum\np = mv changes by\nm∆ = ∆p v . According to the\nSecond Law,\nor     kt t\n∆ ∆∝ =∆ ∆\np pF F\nwhere k  is a constant of proportionality.  Taking\nthe limit ∆t → 0,  the term t∆\n∆p  becomes the\nderivative or differential co-efficient of p with\nrespect to t, denoted by d\ndt\np .  Thus\nd\ndk t= pF (4.2)\nFor a body of fixed mass m,\n( )d d d\nd d dm m m t t t= = =p vv a      (4.3)\ni.e the Second Law can also be written as\nF  =   k m a         (4.4)\nwhich shows that force is proportional to the\nproduct of mass\nm and acceleration a.\nThe unit of force has not been defined so far.\nIn fact, we use Eq. (4.4) to define the unit of force.\nWe, therefor e, have the liberty to choose any\nconstant value for k.  For simplicity, we choose\nk = 1. The second law then is\napF  mt     d\nd  = = (4.5)\nIn SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration\nof 1 m s-2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as\nnewton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\nLet us note at this stage some important points\nabout the second law :\n1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0. The second\nlaw is obviously  consistent with the first law.\n2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is\nequivalent to three equations, one for each\ncomponent of the vectors :\nF\np\nt\nmax\nx\nx= =\nd\nd\nF\np\nt\nmay\ny\ny= =\nd\nd\nz\nz\nz a  mt\npF = =d\nd\n(4.6)\nThis means that if a force is not parallel to\nthe velocity of the body, but makes some angle\nwith it, it changes only the component of\nvelocity along the direction of force.

For example, in the\nmotion of a projectile under the vertical\ngravitational force, the horizontal component\nof velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 4.5).\n3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (4.5) is\napplicable to a single point particle. The force\nF in the law stands for the net external force\non the particle and a stands for acceleration\nof the particle. It turns out, however, that the\nlaw in the same form applies to a rigid body or,\neven more generally, to a system of particles.\nIn that case, F refers to the total external force\non the system and a refers to the acceleration\nof the system as a whole.

What is the origin of the\nexternal force on the body ?  What agency\nprovides the external force ?  The simple answer\nin Newtonian mechanics is that the external\nforce on a body always arises due to some other\nbody.  Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives\nrise to an external force on A.  A natural question\nis: Does A in turn give rise to an external force\non B ?  In some examples, the answer seems\nclear.  If you press a coiled spring, the spring is\ncompressed by the force of your hand.  The\ncompressed spring in turn exerts a force on your\nhand and you can feel it.  But what if the bodies\nare not in contact ?  The earth pulls a stone\ndownwards due to gravity.  Does the stone exert\na force on the earth ?  The answer is not obvious\nsince we hardly see the effect of the stone on the\nearth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,\nthe stone does exert an equal and opposite force\non the earth. We do not notice it since the earth\nis very massive and the effect of a small force on\nits motion is negligible.\nThus, according to Newtonian mechanics,\nforce never occurs singly in nature. Force is the\nmutual interaction between two bodies.  Forces\nalways occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces\nbetween two bodies are always equal and\nopposite.  This idea was expressed by Newton in\nthe form of the third law of motion.\nTo every action, there is always an equal and\nopposite reaction.\nNewton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and\nbeautiful that it has become a part of common\nlanguage. For the same reason perhaps,\nmisconceptions about the third law abound.  Let\nus note some important points about the third\nlaw, particularly in regard to the usage of the\nterms : action and reaction.\n1. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different\nterms for the same physical concept\ncan sometimes be confusing. A simple\nand clear way of stating the third law is as\nfollows:\nForces always occur in pairs.  Force on a\nbody A by B is equal and opposite to the\nforce on the body B by A.\n2. The terms action and reaction in the third law\nmay give a wrong impression that action\ncomes before reaction i.e action is the cause\nand reaction the effect. There is no cause-\neffect relation implied in the third law.  The\nforce on A by B and the force on B by A act\nat the same instant.  By the same reasoning,\nany one of them may be called action and the\nother reaction.\n3. Action and reaction forces act on different\nbodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair\nof bodies A and B.  According to the third law,\nFAB  =  – FBA  (4.8)\n(force on A by B)  =  – (force on B by A)\nThus if we are considering the motion of any\none body (A or B), only one of the two forces is\nrelevant.  It is an error to add up the two forces\nand claim that the net force is zero.\nHowever, if you are considering the system\nof two bodies as a whole, FAB and FBA are\ninternal forces of the system (A + B). They add\nup to give a null force. Internal forces in a\nbody or a system of particles thus cancel away\nLAWS OF MOTION 57\n⊳\nin pairs.

The gravitational force is, of course,\npervasive.  Every object on the earth experiences\nthe force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also\ngoverns the motion of celestial bodies.  The\ngravitational force can act at a distance without\nthe need of any intervening medium.\nAll the other forces common in mechanics are\ncontact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact\nforce on an object arises due to contact with some\nother object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in\ncontact (e.g.  a book resting on a table, a system\nof rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and\nother types of supports), there are mutual\ncontact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying\nthe third law.  The component of contact force\nnormal to the surfaces in contact is called\nnormal reaction.  The component parallel to the\nsurfaces in contact is called friction.  Contact\nforces arise also when solids are in contact with\nfluids.  For example, for a solid immersed in a\nfluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to\nthe weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous\nforce, air resistance, etc are also examples of\ncontact forces (Fig. 4.9).\nTwo other common forces are tension in a\nstring and the force due to spring. When a spring\nis compressed or extended by an external force,\na restoring force is generated. This force is\nusually proportional to the compression or\nelongation (for small displacements). The spring\nforce F is written as F = – k x  where x is the\ndisplacement and k is the force constant. The\nnegative sign denotes that the force is opposite\nto the displacement from the unstretched state.\nFor an inextensible string, the force constant is\nvery high. The restoring force in a string is called\ntension. It is customary to use a constant tension\nT throughout the string. This assumption is true\nfor a string of negligible mass.\nWe lear nt that ther e are four fundamental\nforces in nature.  Of these, the weak and strong\nforces appear in domains that do not concern\nus here. Only the gravitational and electrical\nforces are relevant in the context of mechanics.\nThe different contact forces of mechanics\nmentioned above fundamentally arise from\nelectrical forces.   This may seem surprising\n* We are not considering,  for simplicity, char ged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, ther e are\nelectrical and magnetic non-contact forces.\nFig. 4.9  Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.\nPHYSICS60\nsince we are talking of uncharged and non-\nmagnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic\nlevel, all bodies are made of charged constituents\n(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact\nforces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular\ncollisions and impacts, etc . can ultimately be\ntraced to the electrical forces between the charged\nconstituents of different bodies. The detailed\nmicroscopic origin of these for ces is, however,\ncomplex and not useful for handling problems in\nmechanics at the macroscopic scale.  This is why\nthey are treated as different types of forces with\ntheir characteristic properties determined\nempirically.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "4", "chapter_title": "Laws of Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "4.9", "title": "COMMON FORCES IN MECHANICS", "page_start": 11, "page_end": 12, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["4.9"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "4.9", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "4.9.1  Friction\nLet us return to the example of a body of mass m\nat rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity\n(mg)  is cancelled by the normal reaction force\n(N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied\nhorizontally to the body.  W e know fr om\nexperience that a small  applied force may not\nbe enough to move the body.  But if the applied\nforce F were the only external force on the body,\nit must move with acceleration F/m, however\nsmall. Clearly, the body remains at rest because\nsome other force comes into play in the\nhorizontal direction and opposes the applied\nfor\nce F, resulting in zero net force on the body.\nThis force fs parallel to the surface of the body in\ncontact with the table is known as frictional\nforce, or simply friction (Fig. 4.10(a)).  The\nsubscript stands for static friction to distinguish\nit from kinetic friction fk that we consider later\n(Fig. 4.10(b)).  Note that  static friction does not\nFig. 4.10 Static and sliding friction: (a)  Impending\nmotion of the body is opposed by static\nfriction. When external force exceeds the\nmaximum limit of static friction, the body\nbegins to move.  (b) Once the body is in\nmotion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction\nwhich opposes relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is\nusually less than the maximum value of static\nexist by itself.  When there is no applied force,\nthere is no static friction. It comes into play the\nmoment there is an applied force. As the applied\nforce F increases, fs also increases, remaining\nequal and opposite to the applied force (up to a\ncertain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it\nis called static friction.  Static friction opposes\nimpending motion. The term impending motion\nmeans motion that would take place (but does\nnot actually take place) under the applied force,\nif friction were absent.\nWe know from experience that as the applied\nforce exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to\nmove.  It is found experimentally that the limiting\nvalue of static friction\n( )maxsf  is independent of\nthe area of contact and varies with the normal\nforce(N)  approximately as :\n( )maxs sf N = µ      (4.13)\nwhere µs is a constant of proportionality\ndepending only on the nature of the surfaces in\ncontact. The constant µs  is called the coefficient\nof static friction.  The law of static friction may\nthus be written as\nfs  ≤  µs  N     (4.14)\nIf the applied force F exceeds ( )maxsf  the body\nbegins to slide on the surface. It is found experi-\nmentally that when relative motion has started,\nthe frictional force decreases from the static\nmaximum value\n( )maxsf . Frictional force that\nopposes relative motion between surfaces in\ncontact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is\ndenoted by fk .  Kinetic friction, like static fric-\ntion, is found to be independent of the area of\ncontact.  Further, it is nearly independent of the\nvelocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static\nfriction:\nk k=f N µ (4.15)\nwhere µk′ the coefficient of kinetic friction,\ndepends only on the surfaces in contact. As\nmentioned above, experiments show that µk is\nless than µs. When relative motion has begun,\nthe acceleration of the body according to the\nsecond law is ( F – fk )/m.  For a body moving with\nconstant velocity, F = fk. If the applied force on\nthe body is removed, its acceleration is – fk /m\nand it eventually comes to a stop.\nThe laws of friction given above do not have\nthe status of fundamental laws like those for\ngravitational, electric and magnetic forces.

Yet they are very useful in\npractical calculations in mechanics.\nThus, when two bodies are in contact, each\nexperiences a contact force by the other. Friction,\nby definition, is the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes\nimpending or actual relative motion between the\ntwo surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but\nrelative motion that the frictional force opposes.\nConsider a box lying in the compartment of a train\nthat is accelerating.  If the box is stationary\nrelative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along\nwith the train. What forces cause the acceleration\nof the box?  Clearly, the only conceivable force in\nthe horizontal direction is the force of friction. If\nthere were no friction, the floor of the train would\nslip by and the box would remain at its initial\nposition due to inertia (and hit the back side of\nthe train).

The net\neffect is that the component of the contact force\nparallel to the surface opposes motion.\nWe often r egar d friction as something\nundesirable. In many situations, like in a\nmachine with different moving parts, friction\ndoes have a negative role. It opposes relative\nmotion and thereby dissipates power in the form\nof heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing\nkinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to\nuse ball bearings between two moving parts of a\nmachine [Fig. 4.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction\nbetween ball bearings and the surfaces in\ncontact is very small, power dissipation is\nreduced. A thin cushion of air maintained\nbetween solid surfaces in relative motion is\nanother effective way of reducing friction\n(Fig. 4.13(a)).\nIn many practical situations, however, friction\nis critically needed. Kinetic friction that\ndissipates power is nevertheless important for\nquickly stopping relative motion. It is made use\nof by brakes in machines  and automobiles .\nSimilarly, static friction is important in daily\nlife.  We are able to walk because of friction.  It\nis impossible for a car to move on a very slippery\nroad.

A typical problem in\nmechanics usually does not merely involve a\nsingle body under the action of given forces.\nMore often, we will need to consider an assembly\nof different bodies exerting forces on each other.\nBesides, each body in the assembly experiences\nthe force of gravity.  When trying to solve a\nproblem of this type, it is useful to remember\nthe fact that we can choose any part of the\nassembly and apply the laws of motion to that\npart provided  we include all forces on the chosen\npart due to the  remaining parts of the assembly.\nWe may call the chosen part of the assembly as\nthe system and the remaining part of the\nassembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as\nthe envir onment. We have followed the same\nLAWS OF MOTION 65\n⊳\nmethod in solved examples. To handle a typical\nproblem in mechanics systematically, one\nshould use the following steps :\n(i) Draw a diagram showing schematically the\nvarious parts of the assembly of bodies, the\nlinks, supports, etc.\n(ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly\nas one system.\n(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this\nsystem and all the forces on the system by\nthe remaining part of the assembly.  Include\nalso the forces on the system by other\nagencies. Do not include the forces on the\nenvironment by the system.  A diagram of\nthis type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’.\n(Note this does not imply that the system\nunder consideration is without a net force).\n(iv) In a free-body diagram, include information\nabout forces (their magnitudes and\ndirections) that are either given or you are\nsure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a\nstring along its length).  The rest should be\ntreated as unknowns to be determined using\nlaws of motion.\n(v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for\nanother choice of the system.  In doing so,\nemploy Newton’s third law.

What is the action of the block\non the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor\nyields ? Take g =  10 m s –2.

Its free-body\ndiagram shows two forces on the block, the\nforce of gravitational attraction by the earth\nequal to 2 × 10 = 20 N; and the normal force\nR of the floor on the block. By the First Law,\nthe net force on the block must be zero i.e.,\nR = 20 N.  Using third law the action of the\nblock (i.e. the force exerted on the floor by\nthe block) is equal to 20 N and directed\nvertically downwards.\n(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates\ndownwards with 0.1  m s-2.

Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong.  A\nforce is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.\n2. Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and\narrived at the law of inertia.  Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased\nthus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,\nunless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”.  In simple terms, the First Law\nis “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.\n3. Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :\np  =  m v\n4. Newton’s second law of motion :\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes\nplace in the direction in which the force acts.\nThus\nd\nd\nk k m\nt\n= = pF a\nwhere F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant\nof proportionality k = 1 in SI units.  Then\nd\nd\nm\nt\n= = pF a\nThe SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.\n(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law ( F = 0 implies a = 0)\n(b) It is a vector equation\n(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided  F\nis the total external force on the system and a  is the acceleration of the system as\na whole.\n(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.\nThat is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the\nhistory of motion.\n4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.\nThe notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a\nmeasurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,\none can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during\nthe action of the impulsive force.\n6. Newton’s third law of motion:\nTo every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction\nLAWS OF MOTION 67\nIn simple terms, the law can be stated thus :\nForces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies.  Force on a body A by body\nB is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.\nAction and reaction forces are simultaneous forces.  There is no cause-effect\nrelation between action and reaction.  Any of the two mutual forces can be\ncalled action and the other reaction.  Action and reaction act on different\nbodies and so they cannot be cancelled out.  The internal action and reaction\nforces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.\n7. Law of Conservation of Momentum\nThe total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved.  The law\nfollows from the second and third law of motion.\n8. Friction\nFrictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two\nsurfaces in contact.  It is the component of the contact force along the common\ntangent to the surface in contact.  Static friction\nfs opposes impending relative\nmotion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent\nof the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :\n( )max\nf f Rs s s≤ = µ\nkf R k= µ\nµs (co-efficient of static friction) and µk (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are\nconstants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact.

Force is not always in the direction of motion.  Depending on the situation, F\nmay be along v, opposite to v, normal to\nv or may make some other angle with\nv.  In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.\n2. If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that\nforce or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant.  For example, when a\nball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues\nto be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.\n3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of\nthe body at that time.  Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of\nmotion.  The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is\nno horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding\nair are neglected.  The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.\n4. In the second law of motion F = m  a, F stands for the net force due to all\nmaterial agencies external to the body.  a is the effect of the force.  ma should\nnot be regarded as yet another force, besides F.\nPHYSICS68\n5. The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is\nsimply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a\nbody in cir cular motion. We should always look for some material for ce like\ntension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force\nin any circular motion.\n6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit\nµs N (fs ≤ µs N).  Do not put\nfs= µs N  without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming\ninto play.\n7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in\nequilibrium.  The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an\naccelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third\nlaw.\n8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for\nsimultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in\nordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction.  Action and reaction\nact on different bodies.\n9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,\n‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’\nin different contexts.  For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms\nencountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.\n10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between\ninanimate and animate objects.  An animate object such as a human also\nrequires an external  force to accelerate.  For example, without the external\nforce of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.\n11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the\nsubjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’.  On a merry-go-around, all parts of\nour body are subject to an  inward force,  but we have a feeling of being pushed\noutward – the direction of impending motion.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "4", "chapter_title": "Laws of Motion", "type": "points_to_ponder", "identifier": "points_to_ponder", "title": "POINTS TO PONDER", "page_start": 19, "page_end": 20, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true}}, {"content": "EXERCISES\n(For simplicity in numerical calculations, take g = 10 m s-2)\n4.1 Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on\n(a) a drop of rain falling down with a constant speed,\n(b) a cork of mass 10 g floating  on water,\n(c) a kite skillfully held stationary in the sky,\n(d) a car moving with a constant velocity of 30 km/h on a rough road,\n(e) a high-speed electron in space far from all material objects, and free of\nelectric and magnetic fields.\n4.2 A  pebble of mass 0.05 kg is thrown vertically upwards.

The term potential energy\nbrings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched\nbow-string possesses potential energy. When it\nis released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.\nThe earth’s crust is not uniform, but has\ndiscontinuities and dislocations that are called\nfault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust\nare like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a\nlarge amount of potential energy. An earthquake\nresults when these fault lines readjust. Thus,\npotential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue\nof the position or configuration of a body. The\nbody left to itself releases this stored energy in\nthe form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion\nof potential energy more concrete.\nThe gravitational force on a ball of mass m is\nmg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth\nsurface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h  of\nthe ball above the earth’s surface is very small\ncompared to the earth’s radius RE (h <<RE) so that\nwe can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s\nsurface*. In what follows we have taken the\nupward direction to be positive. Let us raise the\nball up to a height h. The work done by the external\nagency against the gravitational force is mgh. This\nwork gets stored as potential energy.\nGravitational potential energy of an object, as a\nfunction of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it\nis the negative of work done by the gravitational\nforce in raising the object to that height.\nV (h) = mgh\nIf h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that\nthe gravitational force F equals the negative of\nthe derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,\nd\ndF V(h) m gh= − = −\nThe negative sign indicates that the\ngravitational force is downward. When released,\nthe ball comes down with an increasing speed.\nJust before it hits the ground, its speed is given\nby the kinematic relation,\nv2 = 2gh\nThis equation can be written as\n2\n1\nm v2 = m g h\nwhich shows that the gravitational potential\nenergy of the object at height h, when the object\nis released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of\nthe object on reaching the ground.\nPhysically, the notion of potential energy is\napplicable only to the class of forces where work\ndone against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.\nWhen external constraints are removed, it\nmanifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,\n(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential\n* The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 7 on Gravitation.\nPHYSICS78\nenergy V(x) is defined if the force F(x) can be\nwritten as\n( ) d\nd\nVF x x= −\nThis implies that\nF(x) x V V V\nx\nx\ni f\nV\nV\ni\nf\ni\nf\nd d∫ ∫ = − = −\nThe work done by a conservative force such as\ngravity depends on the initial and final positions\nonly.

If an\nobject of mass m is released from rest, from the\ntop of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of\nheight h, its speed at the bottom\nis\ngh2 irrespective of the angle of inclination.\nThus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it\nacquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done\nor the kinetic energy did depend on other factors\nsuch as the velocity or the particular path taken\nby the object, the force would be called non-\nconservative.\nThe  dimensions  of  potential  energy are\n[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as\nkinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change\nin potential energy, for a conservative force,\n∆V  is equal to the negative of the work done by\nthe force\n∆V =\n− F(x) ∆x (5.9)\nIn the example of the falling ball considered in\nthis section we saw how potential energy was\nconverted to kinetic energy.

Suppose\nthat a body undergoes displacement ∆x under\nthe action of a conservative force F. Then from\nthe WE theorem we have,\n∆K =  F(x) ∆x\nIf the force is conservative, the potential energy\nfunction V(x) can be defined such that\n− ∆V  =  F(x) ∆x\nThe above equations imply that\n∆K + ∆V = 0\n∆(K + V ) = 0 (5.10)\nwhich means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic\nand potential energies of the body is a constant.\nOver the whole path,\nxi to xf, this means that\nKi + V(xi ) = Kf  + V(xf) (5.11)\nThe quantity K +V(x), is called the total\nmechanical energy of the system.  Individually\nthe kinetic energy K  and the potential energy\nV(x) may vary from point to point,  but the sum\nis a constant. The aptness of the term\n‘conservative force’ is now clear.\nLet us consider some of  the definitions of a\nconservative force.\nl A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived\nfrom a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation\ngiven by Eq. (5.9). The three-dimensional\ngeneralisation requires the use of a vector\nderivative, which is outside the scope of this\nbook.\nl The work done by the conservative for ce\ndepends only on the end points. This can be\nseen from the relation,\nW = Kf – Ki = V (xi) – V(xf)\nwhich depends on the end points.\nl A third definition states that the work done\nby this force in a closed path is zero.  This is\nonce  again apparent from Eq. (5.11) since\nxi  = xf .\nThus, the principle of conservation of total\nmechanical energy can be stated as\nThe total mechanical energy of a system is\nconserved if the forces, doing work on it, are\nconservative.\nThe above discussion can be made more\nconcrete by considering the example of the\ngravitational force once again and that of the\nspring force in the next section.

The work-energy theorem states  that  the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work\ndone by the net force on the body.\nKf - Ki = Wnet\n2.

The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. W e should refer (or imply\nclearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a\ngiven  body over a certain displacement.\n2. Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and\nkinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction\nor viscous force on a moving body is negative.\n3. For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from\nNewton’s Third Law,\nF12  +  F21  =  0\nBut the sum of the work done by the two forces need not always cancel, i.e.\nW12  + W21\n≠  0\nHowever, it may sometimes be true.\n4. The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of\nthe force is not known. This is clear from Example 5.2 where the WE theorem is\nused in such a situation.\n5. The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem\nmay be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation\nof mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the  WE theorem for\nconservative forces.\n5. The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to non-\ninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the\nnet force acting on the body under consideration.\n7. The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always\nundetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential\nenergy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational  potential energy mgh,\nthe zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring\npotential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position\nof the oscillating mass.\n8. Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential\nenergy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no\npotential energy can be associated with friction.\n9.

(A particle is ideally represented as a\npoint mass having no size.)  W e applied the r esults of our\nstudy even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming\nthat motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the\nmotion of a particle.\nAny r eal body which we encounter in daily life has a\nfinite size.  In dealing with the motion of extended bodies\n(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is\ninadequate.  In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this\ninadequacy.  We shall attempt to build an understanding of\nthe motion of extended bodies.  An extended body, in the\nfirst place, is a system of particles.  We shall begin with the\nconsideration of motion of the system as a whole.  The centre\nof mass of a system of particles will be a key concept her e.\nWe shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system\nof particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding\nthe motion of extended bodies.\nA large class of pr oblems with extended bodies can be\nsolved by considering them to be rigid bodies.  Ideally a\nrigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and\nunchanging shape.  The distances between all pairs of\nparticles of such a body do not change. It is evident from\nthis definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,\nsince real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in\nmany situations the deformations are negligible.  In a number\nof situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel\nbeams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore\nthat they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat\nthem as rigid.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "6", "chapter_title": "System of Particles and Rotational Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "6.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "6.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "6.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have?\nLet us try to explore this question by taking some examples\nof the motion of rigid bodies.

The block is taken as a rigid\nbody.  Its motion down the plane is such that all\nthe particles of the body ar e moving together ,\ni.e. they have the same velocity at any instant\nof time. The rigid body here is in pure\ntranslational motion (Fig. 6.1).\nIn pure translational motion at any\ninstant of time, all particles of the body have\nthe same velocity.\nConsider now the r olling motion of a solid\nmetallic or wooden cylinder down the same\ninclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this\nproblem, namely the cylinder , shifts fr om the\ntop to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,\nseems to have translational motion.  But as Fig.\n6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with\nthe same velocity at any instant. The body,\ntherefore, is not in pure translational motion.\nIts motion is translational plus ‘something else.’\nIn order to understand what this ‘something\nelse’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained\nthat it cannot have translational motion.  The\nmost common way to constrain a rigid body so\nthat it does not have translational motion is to\nfix it along a straight line. The only possible\nmotion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line\nor fixed axis about which the body is rotating is\nits axis of rotation. If you look around, you will\ncome across many examples of rotation about\nan axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant\nwheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig\n6.3(a) and (b)).\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 6.3 Rotation about a fixed axis\n(a) A ceiling fan\n(b) A potter’s wheel.\nLet us try to understand what rotation is,\nwhat characterises rotation.  You may notice that\nin rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis,\nFig 6.1 Translational (sliding) motion of a block down\nan inclined plane.\n(Any point like P 1 or P 2 of the block moves\nwith the same velocity at any instant of time.)\nFig. 6.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder . It is not pure\ntranslational motion. Points P1, P2, P3 and P4\nhave different velocities (shown by arrows)\nat any instant of time. In fact, the velocity of\nthe point of contact P3 is zero at any instant,\nif the cylinder rolls without slipping.\n94 PHYSICS\nevery particle of the body moves in a circle,\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis.  Fig. 6.4 shows\nthe rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis (the z-axis of the frame of reference).  Let P1\nbe a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen\nand at a distance r1 from fixed axis.  The particle\nP1 describes a circle of radius  r1 with its centre\nC1 on the fixed axis.  The circle lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows\nanother particle P 2 of the rigid body, P 2 is at a\ndistance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P 2\nmoves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2\non the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane\nperpendicular to the axis.  Note that the circles\ndescribed by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes;\nboth these planes, however, are perpendicular\nto the fixed axis.  For any particle on the axis\nlike P 3, r = 0. Any such particle remains\nstationary while the body rotates.  This is\nexpected since the axis of rotation is fixed.\nFig. 6.5 (a) A spinning top\n(The point of contact of the top with the\nground, its tip O, is fixed.)\nFig. 6.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating\nblades. The pivot of the fan, point O, is\nfixed. The blades of the fan are under\nrotational motion, whereas, the axis of\nrotation of  the fan blades is oscillating.\nFig. 6.4 A rigid body rotation about the z-axis (Each\npoint of the body such as P 1 or\nP2 describes a circle with its centre (C 1\nor C2) on the axis of rotation.  The radius of\nthe circle (r1or r 2) is the perpendicular\ndistance of the point (P1 or P 2) from the\naxis. A point on the axis like P 3 remains\nstationary).\nAxis of oscillation\nAxis of\nrotation\nfrom blades\nIn some examples of rotation, however, the\naxis may not be fixed.  A prominent example of\nthis kind of rotation is a top spinning in place\n[Fig. 6.5(a)].  (We assume that the top does not\nslip from place to place and so does not have\ntranslational motion.)  We know from experience\nthat the axis of such a spinning top moves\naround the vertical through its point of contact\nwith the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown\nin Fig. 6.5(a).  (This movement of the axis of the\ntop around the vertical is termed precession.)\nNote, the point of contact of the top with\nground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top\nat any instant passes thr ough the point of\ncontact. Another simple example of this kind of\nrotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal\nfan [Fig.6.5(b)]. You may have observed that the\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 95\naxis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating\n(sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about\nthe vertical through the point at which the axis\nis pivoted (point O in Fig. 6.5(b)).\nWhile the fan r otates and its axis moves\nsidewise, this point is fixed.  Thus, in mor e\ngeneral cases of r otation, such as the r otation\nof a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not\none line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case\nthe axis is not fixed, though it always passes\nthrough the fixed point. In our study, however,\nwe mostly deal with the simpler and special case\nof rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.\nThus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis\nonly unless stated otherwise.\nThe r olling motion of a cylinder down an\ninclined plane is a combination of rotation about\na fixed axis and translation.  Thus, the\n‘something else’ in the case of r olling motion\nwhich we referred to earlier is rotational motion.\nYou will find Fig. 6.6(a) and (b) instructive from\nthis point of view. Both these figures show\nmotion of the same body along identical\ntranslational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 6.6(a),\nthe motion is a pur e translation; in the other\ncase [Fig. 6.6(b)] it is a combination of translation\nand rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two\ntypes of motion shown, using a rigid object like\na heavy book.)\nWe now r ecapitulate the most important\nobservations of the present section: The motion\nof a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in\nsome way is either a pure translation or a\ncombination of translation and rotation. The\nmotion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed\nin some way is rotation.  The rotation may be\nabout an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or\nmoving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.6.5(b)]).\nWe shall, in the pr esent chapter , consider\nrotational motion about a fixed axis only.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "6", "chapter_title": "System of Particles and Rotational Motion", "type": "exercises", "identifier": "exercises", "title": "EXERCISES", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 4, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["6.1", "6.2", "6.3", "6.4", "6.5", "6.6"], "figure_count": 6, "styling": {"bold": true, "color": "blue", "capital": true}}}, {"content": "6.2  CENTRE OF MASS\nWe shall first see what the centr e of mass of a\nsystem of particles is and then discuss its\nsignificance.

The symbol ∑ (the Greek letter\nsigma) denotes summation, in this case over n\nparticles. The sum\nim M=∑\nis the total mass of the system.\nSuppose that we have thr ee particles, not\nlying in a straight line. We may define x– and y–\naxes in the plane in which the particles lie and\nrepresent the positions of the three particles by\ncoordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.\nLet the masses of the three particles be m1, m2\nand m3 respectively. The centr e of mass C of\nthe system of the three particles is defined and\nlocated by the coordinates (X, Y) given by\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n1 2 3\nm x m x m xX m m m\n+ += + + (6.3a)\n1 1 2 2 3 3\n1 2 3\nm y m y m yY m m m\n+ += + + (6.3b)\nFor the particles of equal mass m = m1 = m2\n= m3,\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n3 3\nm x x x x x xX m\n+ + + += =\n1 2 3 1 2 3( )\n3 3\nm y y y y y yY m\n+ + + += =\nThus, for three particles of equal mass, the\ncentre of mass coincides with the centroid of the\ntriangle formed by the particles.\nResults of Eqs. (6.3a) and (6.3b) are\ngeneralised easily to a system of n particles, not\nnecessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in\nspace. The centre of mass of such a system is\nat (X, Y, Z ), where\ni im xX M= ∑ (6.4a)\ni im yY M= ∑ (6.4b)\nand\ni im zZ M= ∑ (6.4c)\nHere M = im∑ is the total mass of the\nsystem. The index i runs from 1 to n; mi is the\nmass of the ith particle and the position of the\nith particle is given by (xi, yi, zi).\nEqs. (6.4a), (6.4b) and (6.4c) can be\ncombined into one equation using the notation\nof position vectors.

If the origin of the frame of\nreference (the coordinate system) is chosen to\nbe the centr e of mass then  0i im =∑ r for the\ngiven system of particles.\nA rigid body, such as a metre stick or a\nflywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;\nEqs. (6.4a), (6.4b), (6.4c) and (6.4d) are therefore,\napplicable to a rigid body. The number of\nparticles (atoms or molecules) in such a body is\nso large that it is impossible to carry out the\nsummations over individual particles in these\nequations. Since the spacing of the particles is\nSYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROT ATIONAL MOTION 97\nsmall, we can treat the body as a continuous\ndistribution of mass. We subdivide the body into\nn small elements of mass;  ∆m1, ∆m2... ∆mn; the\nith element  ∆mi is taken to be located about the\npoint  (xi, yi, zi). The coordinates of the centre of\nmass are then approximately given by\n( ) ( ) ( ) , ,\ni i i i i i\ni i i\nm x m y m zX Y Zm m m\n∆ ∆ ∆= = =∆ ∆ ∆\n∑ ∑ ∑\n∑ ∑ ∑\nAs we make n bigger and bigger and each\n∆mi smaller and smaller , these expr essions\nbecome exact. In that case, we denote the sums\nover i by integrals. Thus,\n∆m m Mi → =∫∑ d ,\n( ) ,∆m x x mi i → ∫∑ d\n( ) ,∆m y y mi i → ∫∑ d\nand (∆m z z mi i) → ∫∑ d\nHere M is the total mass of the body. The\ncoordinates of the centre of mass now are\nX M x m Y M y m Z M z m= = = ∫ ∫ ∫\n1 1 1d d d, and     (6.5a)\nThe vector expression equivalent to these\nthree scalar expressions is\nR r= ∫\n1\nM md (6.5b)\nIf we choose, the centre of mass as the origin\nof our coordinate system,\n=R 0\ni.e., r 0dm =∫\nor x m y m z md d d= = =∫ ∫ ∫ 0 (6.6)\nOften we have to calculate the centre of mass of\nhomogeneous bodies of regular shapes like rings,\ndiscs, spheres, rods etc. (By a homogeneous body\nwe mean a body with uniformly distributed\nmass.) By using symmetry consideration, we can\neasily show that the centres of mass of these\nbodies lie at their geometric centres.\nLet us consider a thin rod, whose width and\nbreath (in case the cross section of the rod is\nrectangular) or radius (in case the cross section\nof the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than\nits length. T aking the origin to be at the\ngeometric centr e of the r od and x-axis to be\nalong the length of the rod, we can say that on\naccount of r eflection symmetry, for every\nelement dm of the rod at x, there is an element\nof the same mass dm located at –x (Fig. 6.8).\nThe net contribution of every such pair to\nthe integral and hence the integral\nitself\nis zero.  From Eq. (6.6), the point for which the\nintegral  itself is zer o, is the centr e of mass.\nThus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin\nrod coincides with its geometric centre. This can\nbe understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.\nThe same symmetry argument will apply to\nhomogeneous rings, discs, spher es, or even\nthick r ods of cir cular or r ectangular cr oss\nsection. For all such bodies you will realise that\nfor every element dm at a point (x, y, z) one can\nalways take an element of the same mass at\nthe point (–x, –y, –z). (In other words, the origin\nis a point of r eflection symmetry for these\nbodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (6.5 a)\nall are zero. This means that for all the above\nbodies, their centre of mass coincides with their\ngeometric centre.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "6", "chapter_title": "System of Particles and Rotational Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "6.2", "title": "CENTRE OF MASS", "page_start": 4, "page_end": 6, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["6.6", "6.7", "6.8"], "figure_count": 3, "section_id": "6.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Example 6.1 Find the centre of mass of\nthr ee particles at the vertices of an\nequilateral triangle.

Note that we\nassumed the masses m1, m2, ... etc. do not\nchange in time. We have therefore, treated them\nas constants in dif ferentiating the equations\nwith respect to time.\nDifferentiating Eq.(6.8) with respect to time,\nwe obtain\n1 2\n1 2\ndd dd ...d d d d\nn\nnM m m mt t t t= + + + vv vV\nor\n1 1 2 2 ... n nM m m m= + + +A a a a (6.9)\nwhere ( )1 1 d /d t=a v  is the acceleration of the\nfirst particle,  ( )2 2 d /d t=a v  is the acceleration\nof the second particle etc. and  ( )d /d t=A V  is\nthe acceleration of the centr e of mass of the\nsystem of particles.\nNow, from Newton’s second law, the for ce\nacting on the first particle is given by 1 1 1m=F a .\nThe force acting on the second particle is given\nby 2 2 2m=F a and so on. Eq. (6.9) may be written\nas\n1 2 ... nM = + + +A F F F (6.10)\nThus, the total mass of a system of particles\ntimes the acceleration of its centre of mass is\nthe vector sum of all the forces acting on the\nsystem of particles.\nNote when we talk of the force\n1F on the first\nparticle, it is not a single for ce, but the vector\nsum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise\nfor the second particle etc. Among these forces\non each particle ther e will be external forces\nexerted by bodies outside the system and also\ninternal forces exerted by the particles on one\nanother. We know from Newton’s third law that\nthese internal forces occur in equal and opposite\npairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (6.10), their\ncontribution is zero. Only the external forces\ncontribute to the equation. We can then rewrite\nEq. (6.10) as\nextM =A F (6.11)\nwhere extF  represents the sum of all external\nforces acting on the particles of the system.\nEq. (6.11) states that the centre of mass of\na system of particles moves as if all the mass\nof the system was concentrated at the centre\nof mass and all the external forces were\napplied at that point.\nNotice, to determine the motion of the centre\nof mass no knowledge of inter nal forces of the\nsystem of particles is required; for this purpose\nwe need to know only the external forces.\nTo obtain Eq. (6.11) we did not need to specify\nthe nature of the system of particles. The system\nmay be a collection of particles in which there\nmay be all kinds of internal motions, or it may\nbe a rigid body which has either pure\ntranslational motion or a combination of\ntranslational and rotational motion. Whatever\nis the system and the motion of its individual\nparticles, the centre of mass moves according\nto Eq. (6.11).\nInstead of treating extended bodies as single\nparticles as we have done in earlier chapters,\nwe can now treat them as systems of particles.\nWe can obtain the translational component of\ntheir motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass\nof the system, by taking the mass of the whole\nsystem to be concentrated at the centre of mass\nand all the external forces on the system to be\nacting at the centre of mass.\nThis is the procedure that we followed earlier\nin analysing for ces on bodies and solving\n100 PHYSICS\nproblems without explicitly outlining and\njustifying the procedure. We now realise that in\nearlier studies we assumed, without saying so,\nthat rotational motion and/or inter nal motion\nof the particles were either absent or negligible.\nWe no longer need to do this. We have not only\nfound the justification of the pr ocedur e we\nfollowed earlier; but we also have found how to\ndescribe and separate the translational motion\nof (1) a rigid body which may be r otating as\nwell,  or (2) a system of particles with all kinds\nof internal motion.\nFig. 6.12 The centre of mass of the fragments\nof the pr ojectile continues along the\nsame parabolic path which it would\nhave followed if ther e wer e no\nexplosion.\nFigure 6.12 is a good illustration of Eq.

They contribute nothing to the\nmotion of the centre of mass. The total external\nforce, namely, the force of gravity acting on the\nbody, is the same before and after the explosion.\nThe centre of mass under the influence of the\nexternal force continues, ther efore, along the\nsame parabolic trajectory as it would have\nfollowed if there were no explosion.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "6", "chapter_title": "System of Particles and Rotational Motion", "type": "section", "identifier": "6.3", "title": "MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS", "page_start": 8, "page_end": 9, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["6.12"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "6.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "6.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF\nPARTICLES\nLet us r ecall that the linear momentum of a\nparticle is defined as\nm=p v (6.12)\nLet us also recall that Newton’s second law\nwritten in symbolic form for a single particle is\nd\ndt= pF (6.13)\nwhere F is the force on the particle.

Your\nstretched thumb points in the direction of c.\nIt should be remembered that there are two\nangles between any two vectors  a and b . In\nFig. 6.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to\nθ (as shown)\nand (3600– θ). While applying either of the above\nrules, the rotation should be taken through the\nsmaller angle (<180 0) between  a and b. It is\nθ\nhere.\nBecause of the cross (×) used to denote the\nvector product, it is also referred to as cross product.\n• Note that scalar product of two vectors is\ncommutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a\nThe vector pr oduct, however , is not\ncommutative, i.e. a × b ≠ b × a\nThe magnitude of both a × b and b × a is the\nsame ( sinab θ ); also, both of them ar e\nperpendicular to the plane of  a and b. But the\nrotation of the right-handed scr ew in case of\na × b  is from  a to b, whereas in case of  b × a it\nis from b to a. This means the two vectors ar e\nin opposite directions.

W e\nhave seen that every particle of a rotating body\nmoves in a cir cle. The linear velocity of the\nparticle is r elated to the angular velocity. The\nrelation between these two quantities involves\na vector product which we learnt about in the\nlast section.\nLet us go back to Fig. 6.4. As said above, in\nrotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed\naxis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,\nFig. 6.16 Rotation about a fixed axis. (A particle (P)\nof the rigid body rotating about the fixed\n(z-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)\non the axis.)\nwhich lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis\nand has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 6.16 we\nredraw Fig. 6.4, showing a typical particle (at a\npoint P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed\naxis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes\n104 PHYSICS\na circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius\nof the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of\nthe point P from the axis. W e also show the\nlinear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is\nalong the tangent at P to the cir cle.\nLet P′ be the position of the particle after an\ninterval of time ∆t (Fig. 6.16). The angle PCP ′\ndescribes the angular displacement ∆θ of the\nparticle in time ∆t. The average angular velocity\nof the particle over the interval  ∆t is ∆θ/∆t. As\n∆t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller\nvalues), the ratio ∆θ/∆t approaches a limit which\nis the instantaneous angular velocity d θ/dt of\nthe particle at the position P . We denote the\ninstantaneous angular velocity  by  ω (the\nGreek letter omega). W e know fr om our study\nof circular motion that the magnitude of linear\nvelocity  v of a particle moving in a cir cle is\nrelated to the angular velocity of the particle ω\nby the simple r elation rυ ω= , wher e r is the\nradius of the circle.\nWe observe that at any given instant the\nrelation  v r ω=  applies to  all particles of the\nrigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular\ndistance ri  from the fixed axis, the linear velocity\nat a given instant vi is given by\ni iv r ω= (6.19)\nThe index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the\ntotal number of particles of the body.\nFor particles on the axis, 0=r , and hence\nv = ω r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are\nstationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.\nNote that we use the same angular velocity\nω for all the particles. We therefore, refer to  ω ωω ωω\nas the angular velocity of the whole body.\nWe have characterised pure translation of\na body by all parts of the body having the same\nvelocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we\nmay characterise pure rotation by all parts of\nthe body having the same angular velocity at\nany instant of time . Note that this\ncharacterisation of the rotation of a rigid body\nabout a fixed axis is just another way of saying\nas in Sec. 6.1 that each particle of the body moves\nin a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular\nto the axis and has the centre on the axis.\nIn our discussion so far the angular velocity\nappears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We\nshall not justify this fact, but we shall accept\nit. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular\nvelocity vector lies along the axis of r otation,\nand points out in the direction in which a right\nhanded screw would advance, if the head of the\nscrew is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 6.17a).\nThe magnitude of this vector is\nd dtω θ=\nreferred as above.\nFig. 6.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw\nrotates with the body, the scr ew\nadvances in the direction of the angular\nvelocity ω ωω ωω. If the sense (clockwise or\nanticlockwise) of rotation of the body\nchanges, so does the direction of ω ωω ωω.\nFig. 6.17 (b) The angular velocity vector ω ωω ωω is directed\nalong the fixed axis as shown. The linear\nvelocity of the particle at P is v = ω ωω ωω × r.\nIt is  perpendicular to both ω ω ω ω ω and r and\nis  directed along the tangent to the circle\ndescribed by the particle.\nWe shall now look at what the vector\nproduct ω ωω ωω × r corresponds to. Refer to Fig.\n6.17(b) which is a part of Fig. 6.16 reproduced\nto show the path of the particle P . The figur e\nshows the vector ω ωω ωω directed along the fixed (z–)\naxis and also the position vector  r = OP  of the\nparticle at P of the rigid body with respect to\nthe origin O.

W e may then ask, what is the\nanalogue of force in the case of rotational\nmotion? To look into the question in a concrete\nsituation let us take the example of opening or\nclosing of a door. A door is a rigid body which\ncan rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing\nthrough the hinges. What makes the door\nrotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied\nthe door does not rotate. But any force does not\ndo the job. A force applied to the hinge line\ncannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a\nforce of given magnitude applied at right angles\nto the door at its outer edge is most effective in\nproducing rotation. It is not the force alone, but\nhow and where the force is applied is important\nin rotational motion.\nThe rotational analogue of force in linear\nmotion is moment of force.

We shall then\nextend the definition of angular momentum to\nsystems of particles including rigid bodies.\nLike moment of a force, angular momentum\nis also a vector product. It could also be referred\nto as moment of (linear) momentum. From this\nterm one could guess how angular momentum\nis defined.\nConsider a particle of mass m and linear\nmomentum p at a position r relative to the origin\nO. The angular momentum l of the particle with\nrespect to the origin O is defined to be\nl = r × p (6.25a)\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum\nvector is\nsinl r p= θ (6.26a)\nwhere p is the magnitude of p and θ is the angle\nbetween r and p.

It is the rotational\nanalogue of the relation between force and linear\nmomentum.

Further, since dp / dt = F,\nr p r F× = × =d\ndt t t\nHence\nd\ndt ( )r p× = τ\nor  (6.27)\nThus, the time rate of change of the angular\nmomentum of a particle is equal to the tor que\nacting on it.

One can show\nthat if the translational equilibrium condition\n[Eq. 6.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a\nshift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational\nequilibrium condition is independent of the\nlocation of the origin about which the torques\nare taken. Example 6.7 gives a proof of this result\nin a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces\nacting on a rigid body in translational\nequilibrium. The generalisation of this result to\nn forces is left as an exercise.\nEq. (6.30a) and Eq. (6.30b), both, are vector\nequations. They are equivalent to three scalar\nequations each. Eq.

In a number of\nproblems all the forces acting on the body are\ncoplanar. Then we need only thr ee conditions\nto be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two\nof these conditions correspond to translational\nequilibrium; the sum of the components of the\nforces along any two perpendicular axes in the\nplane must be zero. The third condition\ncorresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum\nof the components of the torques along any axis\nperpendicular to the plane of the forces must\nbe zero.\nThe conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body\nmay be compared with those for a particle, which\nwe considered in earlier chapters. Since\nconsideration of rotational motion does not apply\nto a particle, only the conditions for translational\nequilibrium (Eq. 6.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus,\nfor equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of\nall the forces on it must be zero. Since all these\nforces act on the single particle, they must be\nconcurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent\nforces was discussed in the earlier chapters.\nA body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it\nmay be in translational equilibrium and not in\nrotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational\nequilibrium and not in translational\nequilibrium.\nConsider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod\n(AB) as shown in Fig. 6.20(a).

Thus, we have the same rod with\ntwo forces of equal magnitude but acting in\nopposite diretions applied perpendicular to the\nrod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here\nthe moments of both the forces are equal, but\nthey are not opposite; they act in the same sense\nand cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod.  The\ntotal force on the body is zero; so the body is in\ntranslational equilibrium; but it is not in\nrotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not\nfixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.\nrotation without translation).\nA pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting\nin opposite directions with different lines of\naction is known as a couple or torque. A couple\nproduces rotation without translation.\nWhen we open the lid of a bottle by turning\nit, our fingers ar e applying a couple to the lid\n[Fig. 6.21(a)].

It is then\nevident that the parameter , moment of inertia\nI, is the desired rotational analogue of mass in\nlinear motion. In rotation (about a fixed axis),\nthe moment of inertia plays a similar role as\nmass does in linear motion.\nWe now apply the definition Eq.

(The derivations of these\nexpressions are beyond the scope of this\ntextbook and you will study them in higher\nclasses.)\nAs the mass of a body resists a change in its\nstate of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia\nin linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of\ninertia about a given axis of rotation resists a\nchange in its rotational motion, it can be\nregarded as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body; it is a measure of the way in which\ndifferent parts of the body are distributed at\ndifferent distances from the axis. Unlike the\nmass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a\nfixed quantity but depends on distribution of\nmass about the axis of rotation, and the\norientation and position of the axis of rotation\nwith respect to the body as a whole. As a\nmeasure of the way in which the mass of a\nrotating rigid body is distributed with respect to\nthe axis of rotation, we can define a new\nparameter, the radius of gyration. It is related\nto the moment of inertia and the total mass of\nthe body.\nNotice from the Table 6.1 that in all\ncases, we can write I = Mk 2, where k has\nthe dimension of length. For a rod, about\nthe perpendicular axis at its midpoint,\ni.e.2 2 12,k L=  = 12k L . Similarly, k = R/2\nfor the cir cular disc about its diameter . The\nlength k is a geometric property of the body and\naxis of rotation. It is called the radius of\ngyration. The radius of gyration of a body\nabout an axis may be defined as the distance\nfrom the axis of a mass point whose mass is\nequal to the mass of the whole body and whose\nmoment of inertia is equal to the moment of\ninertia of the body about the axis.\nThus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body\ndepends on the mass of the body, its shape and\nsize; distribution of mass about the axis of\nrotation, and the position and orientation of the\naxis of rotation.\nFrom the definition, Eq. (6.34), we can infer\nthat the dimensions of moments of inertia are\nML2 and its SI units are kg m2.\nThe property of this extremely important\nquantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of\nthe body, has been put to a great practical use.\nThe machines, such as steam engine and the\nautomobile engine, etc., that produce rotational\nmotion have a disc with a large moment of\ninertia, called a flywheel. Because of its large\nmoment of inertia, the flywheel resists the\nsudden increase or decrease of the speed of the\nvehicle.

Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the\nbody do not change, even though there are forces on them.\n2. A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid\nbody not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination\nof translational and rotational motions.\n3. In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in\nthe rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.\n4. In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any\ninstant of time.\n5. Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is\nω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis\nof rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ω ωω ωω has a fixed direction.\n6. The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a×b. The\nmagnitude of this vector is absinθ  and its direction is given by the right handed screw\nor the right hand rule.\n7. The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by\nv = ω ωω ωω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along the\nfixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one\npoint fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed\npoint taken as the origin.\n8. The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position\nvector is\nR\nr\n= ∑ m\nM\ni i\n9. Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, where P is the\nlinear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the\nsystem is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total\nexternal force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is\nconstant.\n10.

To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal\nforces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external\nforces on the body.\n2. Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,\nthe translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of\nmass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One\nexample of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as\nthe kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of the\ncentre of mass MV2/2,\nK = K\n′ + MV2/2\n3. Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in  Newton’s\nSecond Law and also Newton’s Thir d Law for particles.\n4. To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of\nparticles is the total exter nal torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second\nlaw for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between\nany two particles act along the line joining the particles.\n5.

Anything\nthrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot\nmore tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds\nabove fall towards the earth and  there are many other such\nphenomena.  Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo\n(1564-1642) who recognised the fact that all bodies,\nirrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth\nwith a constant acceleration.  It is said  that he made a public\ndemonstration of this fact.  To find the truth, he certainly\ndid experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and\narrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is\nclose to the more accurate value obtained later.\nA seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars,\nplanets and their motion has been the subject of attention\nin many countries since the earliest of times.  Observations\nsince early times recognised stars which appeared in the\nsky with positions unchanged year after year .  The more\ninteresting objects are the planets which seem to have regular\nmotions against the background of stars.  The earliest\nrecorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy\nabout 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all\ncelestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved\naround the earth.  The only motion that was thought to be\npossible for celestial objects was motion in a circle.\nComplicated schemes of motion  were put forward by Ptolemy\nin order to describe the observed motion of the planets.  The\nplanets were described as moving in circles with the centre\nof the circles themselves moving in larger circles.  Similar\ntheories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some\n400 years later.  However a more elegant model in which the\nSun was the centre around which the planets revolved – the\n‘heliocentric’ model – was already mentioned by Aryabhatta\n(5th century A.D.) in his tr eatise.

Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical\norbits with the Sun situated at one of the  foci\nFig. 7.1(a) An ellipse traced out by a planet around\nthe sun. The closest point is P and the\nfarthest point is A, P is called the\nperihelion and A the aphelion. The\nsemimajor axis is half the distance AP.\nFig. 7.1(b) Drawing an ellipse. A string has its ends\nfixed at F1 and F2. The tip of a pencil holds\nthe string taut and is moved around.\nof the ellipse (Fig. 7.1a). This law was a\ndeviation from the Copernican model which\nallowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of\nwhich the circle is a special case, is a closed\ncurve which can be drawn very simply as\nfollows.\nSelect two points F 1 and F2.  Take a length\nof a string and  fix its ends at F 1 and F 2 by\npins.  With the tip of a pencil  stretch the string\ntaut and then draw a curve by moving the\npencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig.\n7.1(b))  The closed curve you get is called an\nellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse,\nthe sum of the distances from F 1 and F 2 is a\nconstant.  F 1, F2 are called the focii. Join the\npoints F 1 and   F2  and extend   the line to\nintersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown\nin Fig. 7.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is\nthe centre of the ellipse O and the length PO =\nAO  is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse.\nFor a circle, the two focii  merge into one  and\nthe semi-major axis becomes the radius of the\ncircle.\n2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet\nto the sun sweeps  equal areas in equal\nintervals of time (Fig. 7.2).  This law comes from\nthe observations that planets appear to move\nslower when they are  farther from the sun\nthan when they ar e nearer.\nFig. 7.2 The planet P moves around the sun in an\nelliptical orbit.

The force on point mass m1\ndue to m2 is of course\n– F by Newton’s third law.\nThus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1\ndue to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to 1 are related\nas F12 = – F21.\nBefore we can apply Eq. (7.5) to objects under\nconsideration, we have to be careful since the\nlaw refers to point masses whereas we deal with\nextended objects which have finite size.

Two large lead\nspheres are brought close to the small ones but\non opposite sides as shown.  The big spheres\nattract the nearby small ones by equal and\nopposite force as shown.  There is no net force\non the bar but only a torque which is clearly\nequal to F times the length of the bar,where F is\nthe force of attraction between a big sphere and\nits neighbouring small sphere.  Due to this\ntorque, the suspended wire  gets twisted till such\ntime as the restoring torque of the wire equals\nthe gravitational torque .

If the position of the particle\nchanges on account of forces acting on it, then\nthe change in its potential energy is just the\namount of work done on the body by the force.\nAs we had discussed earlier, forces for which the\nwork done is independent of the path are the\nconservative forces.\nThe force of gravity is a conservative for ce\nand we can calculate the potential ener gy of a\nbody arising out of this force, called the\ngravitational potential energy. Consider points\nclose to the surface of earth, at distances from\nthe surface much smaller than the radius of the\nearth.  In such cases, the for ce of gravity is\npractically a constant equal to mg, directed\ntowards the centre of the earth.  If we consider a\npoint at a height h1 from the surface of the earth\nand another point vertically above it at a height\nh2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the\nparticle of mass m from the first to the second\nposition is denoted by W12\nW12 = Force × displacement\n= mg\n(h2 – h1) (7.20)\nIf we associate a potential energy W(h) at a\npoint at a height h above the surface such that\nW(h) = mgh  + Wo (7.21)\n(where Wo = constant) ;\nthen it is clear that\nW12 = W(h2)  – W(h1) (7.22)\nThe work done in moving the particle is just\nthe dif ference of potential ener gy between its\nfinal and initial positions.Observe that the\nconstant Wo cancels out in Eq. (7.22).  Setting  h\n= 0 in the last equation, we get   W ( h = 0 ) =  Wo.\n.  h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth.\nThus,  Wo  is the  potential energy on the surface\nof the earth.\nIf we consider points at arbitrary distance\nfrom the sur face of the earth, the r esult just\nderived is not valid since the assumption that\nthe gravitational force mg is a constant is no\nlonger valid.

We restricted ourselves to simpler\nsituations of rigid bodies.  A rigid body generally means a\nhard solid object having a definite shape and size.  But in\nreality,  bodies can be stretched, compr\nessed and bent. Even\nthe  appr eciably  rigid  steel bar can be defor med when a\nsufficiently large external force is applied on it.  This means\nthat solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.\nA solid has  definite shape and size. In order to change (or\ndeform) the shape or size of a body, a for ce  is r equired. If\nyou stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the\nlength of the spring incr eases slightly. When you leave the\nends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape.  The\nproperty of a body, by virtue of  which  it tends to regain its\noriginal size and shape when the applied force is removed, is\nknown as elasticity and the defor mation caused is known\nas elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump\nof putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their\nprevious shape, and they get per manently deformed. Such\nsubstances ar e called plastic and this pr operty is called\nplasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.\nThe elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role\nin engineering design.  For example, while designing a\nbuilding, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel,\nconcrete etc. is essential.  The same is true in the design of\nbridges, automobiles, ropeways etc.  One could also ask  —\nCan we design an aer oplane which is very  light  but\nsufficiently  strong?  Can we design an artificial limb which\nis lighter but str onger?  Why does a railway track have a\nparticular shape  like I?  Why  is glass brittle while brass is\nnot?

The\ndeformation may not be noticeable visually in\nmany materials but it is there. When a body is\nsubjected to a deforming force, a restoring force\nis developed in the body. This restoring force is\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction to\nthe applied force. The restoring force per unit area\nis known as stress.  If F is the force applied normal\nto the cross–section and A  is the  area of cross\nsection of  the body,\nMagnitude of the stress = F/A (8.1)\nThe SI unit of stress is  N m –2 or pascal (Pa)\nand its dimensional formula is [ ML–1T–2 ].\nThere are three ways in which a solid may\nchange its dimensions when an exter nal force\nacts on it. These are shown in Fig. 8.1. In\nFig.8.1(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal\nforces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.\nThe restoring force per unit area  in this case is\ncalled tensile stress . If the cylinder is\ncompressed under the action of applied forces,\nthe restoring force per unit area is known as\ncompressive stress . Tensile or compressive\nstress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.\nIn both the cases, ther e is a change in the\nlength of the cylinder. The change in the length\n∆L to the original length L\nof the body (cylinder\nin this case) is known as longitudinal strain.\nLongitudinal strain\nΔ= L\nL (8.2)\nHowever, if two equal and opposite  deforming\nforces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional\narea of the cylinder , as shown in Fig. 8.1(b),\nther e is r elative displacement between the\nopposite faces of the cylinder.  The restoring force\nper unit ar ea developed due to the applied\ntangential force is known as tangential or\nshearing stress.\nAs a result of applied tangential force, there\nis a relative displacement ∆x between opposite\nfaces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 8.1(b).\nThe strain so pr oduced is known as shearing\nstrain and it is defined as the ratio of relative\ndisplacement of the faces ∆x  to the length of the\ncylinder\nL.\nShearing strain\nΔ= x\nL  = tan θ (8.3)\nwhere θ is the angular displacement of the\ncylinder from the vertical (original position of the\ncylinder). Usually\nθ is very small, tan θ\nis nearly equal to angle θ, (if θ = 10°, for\nexample, there is only 1% difference between θ\nand tan θ).\nIt can also be visualised, when a book is\npressed with the hand and pushed horizontally,\nas shown in Fig. 8.2 (c).\nThus, shearing strain  = tan θ ≈ θ (8.4)\nIn Fig. 8.1 (d), a solid sphere placed in the fluid\nunder high pressure is compressed uniformly on\nall sides. The force applied by the fluid acts in\nperpendicular direction at each point of the\nsurface and the body is said to be under\nhydraulic compression.

Analogous graphs for\ncompression and shear stress may also be\nobtained. The stress-strain curves vary from\nmaterial to material. These curves help us to\nunderstand how a given material deforms with\nincreasing loads. Fr om the graph, we can see\nthat in the region between O to A, the curve is\nlinear.  In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed.\nThe body regains its original dimensions when\nthe applied force is removed. In this region, the\nsolid behaves as an elastic body.\nIn the region from A to B, str ess and strain\nare not proportional.

All engineering\ndesigns require precise knowledge of the elastic\nbehaviour of materials. For example while\ndesigning a building, the structural design of\nthe columns, beams and supports require\nknowledge of strength of materials used. Have\nyou ever thought why the beams used in\nconstruction of bridges, as supp orts etc. have\na cross-section of the type I? Why does a heap\nof sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape?\nAnswers to these questions can be obtained\nfrom the study of structural engineering which\nis based on concepts developed here.\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF SOLIDS 175\nCranes used for lifting and moving heavy loads\nfrom one place to another have a thick metal\nrope to which the load is attached. The rope is\npulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we\nwant to make a crane, which has a lifting\ncapacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric\nton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope\nbe? We obviously want that the load does not\ndeform the rope permanently. Therefore, the\nextension should not exceed the elastic limit.\nFrom Table 8.1, we find that mild steel has a\nyield strength (\nσy) of about 300 × 106 N m–2. Thus,\nthe area of cross-section (A) of the rope should\nat least be\nA ≥ W/σy  =  Mg/σy (8.15)\n=  (104 kg × 9.8 m s-2)/(300 × 106 N m-2)\n=  3.3 × 10-4 m2\ncorresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a\nrope of circular cross-section. Generally a\nlarge margin of safety (of about a factor of ten\nin the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of\nradius about 3 cm is recommended. A single\nwire of this radius would practically be a rigid\nrod. So the ropes are always made of a number\nof thin wires braided together , like in pigtails,\nfor ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength.\nA bridge has to be designed such that it can\nwithstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force\nof winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the\ndesign of buildings the use of beams and columns\nis very common. In both the cases, the\novercoming of the problem of bending of beam\nunder a load is of prime importance. The beam\nshould not bend too much or break. Let us\nconsider the case of a beam loaded at the centre\nand supported near its ends as shown in\nFig. 8.6.  A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth\nd when loaded at the centre by a load W sags by\nan amount given by\nδ = W l 3/(4bd 3Y) (8.16)\nThis relation can be derived using what you\nhave already learnt and a little calculus. From\nEq. (8.16), we see that to reduce the bending\nfor a given load, one should use a material with\na large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material,\nincreasing the depth d rather than the breadth\nb is more effective in reducing the bending, since\nδ  is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course\nthe length l of the span should be as small as\npossible). But on increasing the depth, unless\nthe load is exactly at the right place (difficult to\narrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the\ndeep bar  may bend as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). This\nis called buckling. To avoid this, a common\ncompromise is the cross-sectional shape shown\nin Fig. 8.7(c). This section provides a large load-\nbearing surface and enough depth to prevent\nbending. This shape reduces the weight of the\nbeam without sacrificing the strength and\nhence reduces the cost.\nFig. 8.6 A beam supported at the ends and loaded\nat the centre.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig. 8.7 Different cross-sectional shapes of a\nbeam.

A pillar with\nrounded ends as shown in Fig. 8.9(a) supports\nless load than that with a distributed shape at\nthe ends [Fig. 8.9(b)]. The precise design of a\nbridge or a building has to take into account\nthe conditions under which it will function, the\ncost and long period, reliability of usable\nmaterial, etc.\n176 PHYSICS", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "8", "chapter_title": "Mechanical Properties of Solids", "type": "section", "identifier": "8.6", "title": "APPLICATIONS OF ELASTIC", "page_start": 8, "page_end": 10, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["8.6", "8.7", "8.9"], "figure_count": 3, "section_id": "8.6", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "SUMMARY\n1. Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension.\nIn general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress\n(associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression),\n(b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress.\n2. For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials.\nThis is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of\nelasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus\nare used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces\nthat act on them.\nA class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law.\n3. When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form\nF/A  = Y∆L/L\nwhere  ∆L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the\napplied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied\n(perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A.\n4. A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so\nthat the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement\n∆L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is\ncalled shear\nand the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is\npossible only in solids.\nIn this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form\nF/A = G × ∆L/L\nwhere ∆L is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F,\nand G is the shear modulus.\n5. When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding\nfluid, the Hooke’s law takes the form\np = B (∆V/V),\nwhere p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, ∆V/V  (the\nvolume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that\npressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object.\n(a)                         (b)\nFig. 8.8 Pillars or columns: (a) a pillar with rounded\nends, (b) Pillar with distributed ends.\nThe answer to the question why the maximum\nheight of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can\nalso be provided by considering the elastic\nproperties of rocks. A mountain base is not under\nuniform compression and this provides some\nshearing stress to the rocks under which they\ncan flow. The stress due to all the material on\nthe top should be less than the critical shearing\nstress at which the rocks flow.\nAt the bottom of a mountain of height h, the\nforce per unit area due to the weight of the\nmountain is h\nρg where ρ is the density of the\nmaterial of the mountain and g is the acceleration\ndue to gravity. The material at the bottom\nexperiences this force in the vertical direction,\nand the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore,\nthis is not a case of pressure or bulk compression.\nThere is a shear component, approximately h\nρg\nitself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is\n30 × 10 7 N m -2. Equating this to hρg, with\nρ  = 3 × 103 kg m-3 gives\nhρg  = 30 × 107 N m-2 .\nh      =  30 × 107 N m-2/(3 × 103 kg m-3 × 10 m s-2)\n= 10 km\nwhich is more than the height of Mt.

Liquids and gases can  flow\nand are ther efore, called  fluids.  It is this pr operty that\ndistinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.\nFluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of\nair and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water.  Water\nis not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian\nbody constitute mostly of water. All the  processes occurring\nin living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus\nunderstanding the behaviour and pr operties of fluids is\nimportant.\nHow are fluids different from solids? What is common in\nliquids and gases? Unlike  a solid, a fluid has no definite\nshape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,\nwhereas a gas fills the entir e volume of its container . We\nhave learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids\ncan be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas\ndepends on the str ess or pr essure acting on it. When we\ntalk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume\nunder atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases\nand solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change\nin volume due to  change of external pressure is rather small.\nIn other wor ds solids and liquids have much lower\ncompressibility as compared to gases.\nShear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its\nvolume fixed. The key pr operty of fluids is that they of fer\nvery little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by\napplication of very small shear str ess. The shearing str ess\nof fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "9", "chapter_title": "Mechanical Properties of Fluids", "type": "section", "identifier": "9.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "9.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "9.2  PRESSURE\nA sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it.

Such\neveryday experiences convince us that both the\nforce and its coverage area are important. Smaller\nthe area on which the force acts, greater is the\nimpact. This impact is known as pressure.\nWhen an object is submer ged in a fluid at\nrest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This\nforce is always nor mal to the object’s sur face.\nThis is so because if there wer\ne a component of\nforce parallel to the surface, the object will also\nexert a for ce on the fluid parallel to it; as a\nconsequence of Newton’s thir d law. This for ce\nwill cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.\nSince the fluid is at r est, this cannot happen.\nHence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has\nto be perpendicular to the sur face in contact\nwith it. This is shown in Fig.9.1(a).\nThe normal force exerted by the fluid at a point\nmay be measured. An idealised form of one such\npressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.\n9.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with\na spring that is calibrated to measure the force\nacting on the piston. This device is placed at a\npoint inside the fluid. The inward force exerted\nby the fluid on the piston is balanced by the\noutward spring force and is thereby measured.\nIf F is the magnitude of this normal force on the\npiston of area A then the average pressure Pav\nis defined as the nor mal force acting per unit\narea.\nP F\nAav =              (9.1)\nIn principle, the piston area can be made\narbitrarily small.

We remind the\nreader that it is the component of the for ce\nnormal to the area under consideration and not\nthe (vector) force that appears in the numerator\nin Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2). Its dimensions are\n[ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has\nbeen named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the\nFrench scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who\ncarried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.\nA common unit of pr essure is the atmospher e\n(atm), i.e. the pr essur e exerted by the\natmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 × 105 Pa).\nAnother quantity, that is indispensable in\ndescribing fluids, is the density\nρ. For a fluid of\nmass m occupying volume V,\nρ = m\nV (9.3)\nThe dimensions of density are [ML –3]. Its SI\nunit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity.

The pressure inside\nthe coloumn at Point B must be the same as the\npressure at Point C, which is atmospheric\npressure, Pa.\nPa = ρgh (9.8)\nwhere ρ is the density of mercury and h is the\nheight of the mercury column in the tube.\n184 PHYSICS\n⊳\n⊳\nIn the experiment it is found that the mercury\ncolumn in the barometer has a height of about\n76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere\n(1 atm). This can also be obtained using the\nvalue of ρ in Eq. (9.8). A common way of stating\npressure is in ter ms of cm or mm of mer cury\n(Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a\ntorr (after Torricelli).\n1 torr = 133 Pa.\nThe mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine\nand physiology. In meteorology, a common unit\nis the bar and millibar.\n1 bar = 105 Pa\nAn open tube manometer is a useful\ninstrument for measuring pressure differences.\nIt consists of a U-tube containing a suitable\nliquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for\nmeasuring small pressure differences and a\nhigh density liquid (such as mercury) for large\npressure differences. One end of the tube is open\nto the atmosphere and the other end is\nconnected to the system whose pressure we want\nto measure [see Fig. 9.5 (b)]. The pressure P at A\nis equal to pressure at point B. What we\nnormally measure is the gauge pressure, which\nis P − Pa, given by Eq. (9.8) and is proportional to\nmanometer height h.\nPressure is same at the same level on both\nsides of the U-tube containing a fluid. For\nliquids, the density varies very little over wide\nranges in pressure and temperature and we can\ntreat it safely as a constant for our present\npurposes.

The study\nof the fluids in motion is known as fluid\ndynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly,\nthe water flow is smooth initially, but loses its\nsmoothness when the speed of the outflow is\nincreased. In studying the motion of fluids, we\nfocus our attention on what is happening to\nvarious fluid particles at a particular point in\nspace at a particular time. The flow of the fluid\nis said to be steady if at any given point, the\nvelocity of each passing fluid particle remains\nconstant in time. This does not mean that the\nvelocity at different points in space is same. The\nvelocity of a particular particle may change as it\nmoves from one point to another. That is, at some\nother point the particle may have a different\nvelocity, but every other particle which passes\nthe second point behaves exactly as the previous\nparticle that has just passed that point. Each\nparticle follows a smooth path, and the paths of\nthe particles do not cross each other.\nFig. 9.7 The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical\ntrajectory of a fluid particle.\n(b) A region of streamline flow.\nThe path taken by a fluid particle under a\nsteady flow is a streamline. It is defined as a\ncurve whose tangent at any point is in the\ndirection of the fluid velocity at that point.\nConsider the path of a particle as shown in\nFig.9.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid\nparticle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a\nMECHANICAL PROPER TIES OF FLUIDS 187\npermanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the\nfluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for\nif they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go\neither one way or the other and the flow would\nnot be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of\nflow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely\nspaced streamlines ? If we intend to show\nstreamline of every flowing particle, we would\nend up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes\nperpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g.,\nat three points P, R and Q in Fig.9.7 (b). The plane\npieces are so chosen that their boundaries be\ndetermined by the same set of streamlines. This\nmeans that number of fluid particles crossing\nthe surfaces as indicated at P , R and Q is the\nsame. If area of cross-sections at these points\nare AP,AR and AQ and speeds of fluid particles\nare vP, vR and vQ, then mass of fluid ∆mP crossing\nat AP in a small interval of time ∆t is ρPAPvP ∆t.\nSimilarly mass of fluid ∆mR flowing or crossing\nat AR in a small interval of time ∆t is  ρRARvR ∆t\nand mass of fluid  ∆mQ is ρQAQvQ ∆t crossing at\nAQ. The mass of liquid flowing out equals the\nmass flowing in, holds in all cases. Therefore,\nρPAPvP∆t = ρRARvR∆t = ρQAQvQ∆t (9.9)\nFor flow of incompressible fluids\nρP = ρR = ρQ\nEquation (9.9) reduces to\nAPvP = ARvR = AQvQ (9.10)\nwhich is called the equation of continuity and\nit is a statement of conservation of mass in flow\nof incompressible fluids. In general\nAv = constant (9.11)\nAv gives the volume flux or flow rate and\nremains constant throughout the pipe of flow.\nThus, at narrower portions where the\nstreamlines are closely spaced, velocity\nincreases and its vice versa.

But we\ncan obtain some useful properties for steady\nor streamline flows using the conservation\nof energy.\nConsider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying\ncross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying\nheights as shown in Fig. 9.9. We now suppose\nthat an incompressible fluid is flowing through\nthe pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must\nchange as a consequence of equation of\ncontinuity. A force is required to produce this\nacceleration, which is caused by the fluid\nsurrounding it, the pressure must be different\nin different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a\ngeneral expression that relates the pressure\ndifference between two points in a pipe to both\nvelocity changes (kinetic energy change) and\nelevation (height) changes (potential energy\nchange). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli\ndeveloped this relationship in 1738.\nConsider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC)\nand 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying\nbetween B and D. In an infinitesimal time\ninterval ∆t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose\nv1 is the speed at B and v2 at D, then fluid initially\nat B has moved a distance v1∆t to C (v1∆t is small\nenough to assume constant cross-section along\nBC). In the same interval ∆t the fluid initially at\nD moves to E, a distance equal to v2∆t. Pressures\nP1 and P2 act as shown on the plane faces of\nareas A1 and A2 binding the two regions. The\nwork done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W1 =\nP1A1(v1∆t) = P1∆V. Since the same volume ∆V\npasses through both the regions (from the\nequation of continuity) the work done by the fluid\nat the other end (DE) is W2 = P2A2(v2∆t) = P2∆V or,\n188 PHYSICS\nthe work done on the fluid is  –P2∆V. So the total\nwork done on the fluid is\nW1 – W2 =  (P1− P2) ∆V\nPart of this work goes into changing the kinetic\nenergy of the fluid, and part goes into changing\nthe gravitational potential energy. If the density\nof the fluid is ρ and ∆m = ρA1v1∆t = ρ∆V is the\nmass passing through the pipe in time ∆t, then\nchange in gravitational potential energy is\n∆U = ρg∆V (h2 − h1)\nThe change in its kinetic energy is\n∆K =\n1\n2\nρ ∆V (v2\n2 − v1\n2)\nWe can employ the work – ener gy theorem\n(Chapter 6) to this volume of the fluid and\nthis yields\n(P1− P2) ∆V =\n1\n2\nρ ∆V (v2\n2 − v1\n2) + ρg∆V (h2 − h1)\nWe now divide each term by ∆V to obtain\n(P1− P2) =\n1\n2\nρ (v2\n2 − v1\n2) + ρg (h2 − h1)\nWe can rearrange the above terms to obtain\nP1 +\n1\n2\nρv1\n2 + ρgh1 = P2+\n1\n2\nρv2\n2 + ρgh2\n(9.12)\nThis is Bernoulli’s equation. Since 1 and 2\nrefer to any two locations along the pipeline, we\nmay write the expression in general as\nP +\n1\n2\nρv2 + ρgh = constant (9.13)\nIn words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be\nstated as follows: As we move along a streamline\nthe sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy\nper unit volume\nρv2\n2\n\n\n\n  and the potential energy\nper unit volume (ρgh) remains a constant.\nNote that in applying the energy conservation\nprinciple, there is an assumption that no energy\nis lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids\nflow, some energy does get lost due to internal\nfriction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid\nflow, the different layers of the fluid flow with\ndifferent velocities. These layers exert frictional\nforces on each other resulting in a loss of energy.\nThis property of the fluid is called viscosity and\nis discussed in more detail in a later section. The\nlost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into\nheat energy. Thus, Bernoulli’s equation ideally\napplies to fluids with zero viscosity or non-\nviscous fluids. Another restriction on application\nof Bernoulli theorem is that the fluids must be\nincompressible, as the elastic energy of the fluid\nis also not taken into consideration. In practice,\nit has a large number of useful applications and\ncan help explain a wide variety of phenomena\nfor low viscosity incompressible fluids.\nBernoulli’s equation also does not hold for non-\nsteady or turbulent flows, because in that\nsituation velocity and pressure are constantly\nfluctuating in time.\nWhen a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero\neverywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes\nP1 + ρgh1 = P2 + ρgh2\n(P1− P2) = ρg (h2 − h1)\nwhich is same as Eq.

The ball is moving\nforward and relative to it the air is moving\nbackwards. Therefore, the velocity of air\nabove the ball relative to the ball is larger\nand below it is smaller (see Section 9.3).\nThe stream lines, thus, get crowded above\nand rarified below.\nThis difference in the velocities of air results\nin the pressure difference between the lower and\nupper faces and there is a net upward force on\nthe ball.

Suppose we consider\na fluid  like oil  enclosed between two glass plates\nas shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). The bottom plate is fixed\nwhile the top plate is moved with a constant\nvelocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is\nreplaced by honey, a greater force is required to\nmove the plate with the same velocity. Hence\nwe say that honey is more viscous than oil. The\nfluid in contact with a surface has the same\nvelocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer\nof the liquid in contact with top surface moves\nwith a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in\ncontact with the fixed surface is stationary. The\nvelocities of layers increase uniformly from\nbottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity\nv).

The other quantities on which the force\nF depends are viscosity η of the fluid and radius\na of the sphere. Sir George G.

This attraction results\nin a negative potential energy for the molecule,\nwhich depends on the number and distribution\nof molecules around the chosen one.

The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any\nresistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the\nshape of its container .\n2. A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible\nand it expands to occupy all the space available to it.\n3. If F is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area A then the average pressure Pav\nis defined as the ratio of the force to area\nA\nFPav =\n198 PHYSICS\n4. The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m -2. Other common\nunits of pressure are\n1 atm = 1.01×105 Pa\n1 bar = 105 Pa\n1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa\n1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa\n5. Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at\nthe same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted\nundiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.\n6. The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression\nP = Pa + ρgh\nwhere  ρ is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.\n7. The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of\nnon uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow.\nv A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)\nThe equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.\n8. Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the\npressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume ( ρv2/2) and the potential energy per\nunit volume ( ρgy) remains a constant.\nP + ρv2/2 + ρgy = constant\nThe equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss fluid\nmotion in steady state. There is no fluid which have zero viscosity, so the above\nstatement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the\nkinetic energy to heat energy.\n9. Though shear strain in a fluid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is\napplied to a fluid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing\nwith time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known\nas coefficient of viscosity, η.\nwhere symbols have their usual meaning and are defined in the text.\n10. Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with\nvelocity v through a fluid of viscosity is, F = 6π\nηav.\n11.

Pressure is a scalar quantity . The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area”\nmay give one false impression that pressure is a vector.

While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body\nmechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point\nin the fluid.\n2.  One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the\nwalls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at\nall points in a fluid.

Below\n4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore, the\ndensity decreases [Fig. 10.7(b)].\nThis means that water has the maximum\ndensity at 4 °C. This property has an important\nenvironmental effect: bodies of water , such as\nlakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake\ncools toward 4\n°C, water near the surface loses\nenergy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and\nsinks; the war mer, less dense water near the\nbottom rises.

For liquids, the\ncoefficient of volume expansion is r elatively\nindependent of the temperatur e. However, for\ngases it is dependent on temperatur e.

It implies that every\nsubstance has a unique value for the amount of\nheat absorbed or given off to change the\ntemperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This\nquantity is referred to as the specific heat\ncapacity of the substance.\nIf ∆Q stands for the amount of heat absorbed\nor given off by a substance of mass m when it\nundergoes a temperature change ∆T, then the\nspecific heat capacity, of that substance is given\nby\n1S Qs m m T\n∆= = ∆ (10.11)\nThe specific heat capacity is the property of\nthe substance which determines the change in\nthe temperature of the substance (undergoing\nno phase change) when a given quantity of heat\nis absorbed (or given off) by it. It is defined as the\namount of heat per unit mass absorbed or given\noff by the substance to change its temperature\nby one unit. It depends on the nature of the\nsubstance and its temperature. The SI unit of\nspecific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.\nIf the amount of substance is specified in\nterms of moles\nµ, instead of mass m in kg, we\ncan define heat capacity per mole of the\nsubstance by\n(10.12)\nwhere C is known as molar specific heat\ncapacity  of the substance.

These changes\ncan occur when the exchange of heat takes place\nbetween the substance and its surr oundings.\nTo study the change of state on heating or\ncooling, let us perform the following activity.\nTake some cubes of ice in a beaker. Note the\ntemperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a\nconstant heat source. Note the temperature after\nevery  minute.  Continuously stir the mixture of\nwater and ice. Draw a graph between\ntemperature and time (Fig. 10.9). You will observe\nno change in the temperature as long as there\nis ice in the beaker . In the above pr ocess, the\ntemperature of the system does not change even\nthough heat is being continuously supplied.

Thus, the wire passes through the slab\nand the slab does not split. This phenomenon\nof r efreezing is called regelation.

Later, bubbles of steam will for m at\nthe bottom but as they rise to the cooler water\nnear the top, they condense and disappear .\nFinally, as the temperatur e of the entir e mass\nof the water reaches 100  °C, bubbles of steam\nreach the surface and boiling is said to occur .\nThe steam in the flask may not be visible but as\nit comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny\ndroplets of water, giving a foggy appearance.\nFig. 10.11 Boiling process.\nIf now the steam outlet is closed for a few\nseconds to incr ease the pr essure in the flask,\nyou will notice that boiling stops. Mor e heat\nwould be r equired to raise the temperatur e\n(depending on the increase in pressure) before\nboiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases\nwith increase in pressure.\nLet us now remove the burner. Allow water to\ncool to about 80 °C. Remove the thermometer and\nsteam outlet. Close the flask with the airtight\ncork. Keep the flask turned upside down on the\nstand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. W ater\nvapours in the flask condense r educing the\npressure on the water surface inside the flask.\nWater begins to boil again, now at a lower\ntemperature. Thus boiling point decreases with\ndecrease in pressure.\nThis explains why cooking is difficult on hills.\nAt high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower,\nreducing the boiling point of water as compared\nto that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling\npoint is increased inside a pr essure cooker by\nincreasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster.\nThe boiling point of a substance at standar d\natmospheric pr essur e is called its normal\nboiling point.\nHowever, all substances do not pass through\nthe thr ee states: solid-liquid-gas. Ther e ar e\ncertain substances which nor mally pass fr om\nthe solid to the vapour state dir ectly and vice\nversa. The change fr om solid state to vapour\nstate without passing thr ough the liquid state\nis called sublimation, and the substance is said\nto sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also\niodine. During the sublimation process both the\nsolid and vapour states of a substance coexist\nin thermal equilibrium.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Thermal Properties of Matter", "type": "section", "identifier": "10.8", "title": "CHANGE OF STATE", "page_start": 9, "page_end": 11, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.10", "10.11", "10.9"], "figure_count": 3, "section_id": "10.8", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.8.1  Latent Heat\nIn Section 10.8, we have learnt that certain\namount of heat energy is transferred between a\nsubstance and its surr oundings when it\nundergoes a change of state. The amount of heat\nper unit mass transferred during change of state\nof the substance is called latent heat of the\nsubstance for the process. For example, if heat\nis added to a given quantity of ice at –10 °C, the\ntemperature of ice increases until it reaches its\nmelting point (0  °C). At this temperature, the\naddition of mor e heat does not incr ease the\ntemperatur e but causes the ice to melt, or\nchanges its state. Once the entir e ice melts,\nadding more heat will cause the temperature of\nthe water to rise. A similar situation\noccurs during liquid gas change of state at the\nboiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water\ncauses vaporisation, without increase in\ntemperature.\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 213\n⊳\nThe heat required during a change of state\ndepends upon the heat of transformation and\nthe mass of the substance undergoing a change\nof state. Thus, if mass m of a substance\nundergoes a change from one state to the other,\nthen the quantity of heat required is given by\nQ = m L\nor L = Q/m (10.13)\nwhere L is known as latent heat and is a\ncharacteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is\nJ kg –1. The value of L also depends on the\npressure. Its value is usually quoted at standard\natmospheric pressure. The latent heat for a solid-\nliquid state change is called the latent heat of\nfusion (Lf), and that for a liquid-gas state change\nis called the latent heat of vaporisation  (Lv).\nThese are often referred to as the heat of fusion\nand the heat of vaporisation.

It is  possible only in fluids.\nConvection can be natural or forced. In natural\nconvection, gravity plays an important part.\nWhen a fluid is heated from below, the hot part\nexpands and, ther efore, becomes less dense.\nBecause of buoyancy, it rises and the upper\ncolder part replaces it. This again gets heated,\nrises up and is replaced by the relatively colder\npart of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode\nof heat transfer is evidently different from\nconduction. Convection involves bulk transport\nof different parts of the fluid.\nIn forced convection, material is forced to move\nby a pump or by some other physical means. The\ncommon  examples of forced convection systems\nare forced-air heating systems in home, the\nhuman circulatory system, and the cooling\nsystem of an automobile engine. In the human\nbody, the heart acts as the pump that circulates\nblood through different parts of the body,\ntransferring heat by forced convection and\nmaintaining it at a uniform temperature.\nNatural convection is responsible for many\nfamiliar phenomena. During the day, the\nground heats up more quickly than large bodies\nof water do. This occurs both because water has\na greater specific heat capacity and because\nmixing currents disperse the absorbed heat\nthroughout the great volume of water. The air\nin contact with the warm ground is heated by\nconduction. It expands, becoming less dense\nthan the surrounding cooler air. As a result, the\nwarm air rises (air currents) and the other air\nmoves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea\nbreeze near a lar ge body of water . Cooler air\ndescends, and a thermal convection cycle is set\nup, which transfers heat away from the land.\nAt night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,\nand the water surface is warmer than the land.\nAs a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 10.17).\nThe other example of natural convection is\nthe steady sur face wind on the earth blowing\nin fr om north-east towar ds the equator , the\nso-called trade wind. A resonable explanation\nis as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of\nthe earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the\nearth’s surface near the equator is hot, while\nthe air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is\ncool. In the absence of any other factor , a\nconvection curr ent would be set up, with the\nair at the equatorial surface rising and moving\nout towar ds the poles, descending and\nstreaming in towards the equator. The rotation\nof the earth, however, modifies this convection\ncurrent. Because of this, air close to the equator\nhas an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it\nis zero close to the poles. As a r esult, the air\ndescends not at the poles but at 30 ° N (North)\nlatitude and r eturns to the equator . This is\ncalled trade wind.\nFig. 10.17 Convection cycles.\n218 PHYSICS", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Thermal Properties of Matter", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "10.9.2", "title": "Convection", "page_start": 16, "page_end": 17, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.17"], "figure_count": 1, "subsection_id": "10.9.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.9.3  Radiation\nConduction and convection require some\nmaterial as a transport medium. These modes\nof heat transfer cannot operate between bodies\nseparated by a distance in vacuum. But the\nearth does receive heat from the Sun across a\nhuge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the\nwarmth of the fire nearby even though air\nconducts poorly and before convection takes\nsome time to set in. The third mechanism for\nheat transfer needs no medium; it is called\nradiation and the energy so transferred by\nelectromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.\nIn an electromagnetic wave, electric and\nmagnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like\nany wave, electromagnetic waves can have\ndifferent wavelengths and can travel in vacuum\nwith the same speed, namely the speed of light\ni.e., 3 × 108 m s–1 . You will learn these matters in\nmore detail later, but you now know why heat\ntransfer by radiation does not need any medium\nand why it is so fast. This is how heat is\ntransferred to the earth from the Sun through\nempty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,\nwhether they are solid, liquid or gas. The\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by\nvirtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red\nhot iron or light from a filament lamp is called\nthermal radiation.\nWhen this ther mal radiation falls on other\nbodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.\nThe amount of heat that a body can absorb by\nradiation depends on the colour of the body.\nWe find that black bodies absorb and emit\nradiant energy better than  bodies of lighter\ncolours. This fact finds many applications in our\ndaily life. We wear white or light coloured clothes\nin summer, so that they absorb the least heat\nfrom the Sun. However, during winter, we use\ndark coloured clothes, which absorb heat from\nthe sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of\nutensils for cooking food are blackened so that\nthey absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer\nit to the vegetables to be cooked.\nSimilarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is\na device to minimise heat transfer between the\ncontents of the bottle and outside. It consists\nof a double-walled glass vessel with the inner\nand outer walls coated with silver . Radiation\nfrom the inner wall is reflected back to the\ncontents of the bottle.

The important\nthing about thermal radiation at any\ntemperature is that it is not of one (or a few)\nwavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum\nfrom the small to the long wavelengths. The\nenergy content of radiation, however, varies for\ndifferent wavelengths. Figure 10.18 gives the\nexperimental curves for radiation energy per unit\narea per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody\nversus wavelength for different temperatures.\nFig. 10.18:  Energy emitted versus wavelength\nfor a blackbody at different\ntemperatures\nNotice that the wavelength λm for which energy\nis the maximum decreases with increasing\ntemperature. The relation between λm and T is\ngiven by what is known as Wien’s Displacement\nLaw:\nλm T  =  constant (10.15)\nThe value of the constant (Wien’s constant)\nis 2.9 × 10 –3 m K. This law explains why the\ncolour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame\nfirst becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and\nfinally white hot. Wien’s law is useful for\nestimating the surface temperatures of celestial\nTHERMAL PROPER TIES OF MA TTER 219\nbodies like, the moon, Sun and other stars. Light\nfrom the moon is found to have a maximum\nintensity near the wavelength 14 µm. By Wien’s\nlaw, the surface of the moon is estimated to have\na temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a\nmaximum at λm = 4753 Å. This corresponds to\nT = 6060 K. Remember, this is the temperature\nof the surface of the sun, not its interior.\nThe most significant feature of the\nblackbody radiation curves in Fig. 10.18 is that\nthey are universal. They depend only on the\ntemperature and not on the size, shape or\nmaterial of the blackbody. Attempts to explain\nblackbody radiation theoretically, at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century, spurred the\nquantum revolution in physics, as you will\nlearn in later courses.\nEnergy can be transferred by radiation over\nlarge distances, without a medium (i.e. , in\nvacuum). The total electromagnetic energy\nradiated by a body at absolute temperature T\nis proportional to its size, its ability to radiate\n(called emissivity)  and most importantly to its\ntemperature. For a body , which is a perfect\nradiator, the ener gy emitted per unit time ( H)\nis given by\nH = A\nσT 4 (10.16)\nwhere A is the area and T is the absolute\ntemperature of the body.  This relation obtained\nexperimentally by Stefan and later proved\ntheoretically by Boltzmann is known as Stefan-\nBoltzmann law  and the constant\nσ is called\nStefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units\nis 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4. Most bodies emit only a\nfraction of the rate given by Eq. 10.16. A substance\nlike lamp black comes close to the limit. One,\ntherefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e\ncalled emissivity and writes,\nH = Ae\nσT 4 (10.17)\nHere, e = 1 for a perfect radiator. For a tungsten\nlamp, for example, e is about 0.4. Thus, a tungsten\nlamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface\narea of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate  H = 0.3 ×\n10–4 × 0.4 × 5.67 × 10–8 × (3000)4 = 60 W.\nA body at temperature T, with surroundings\nat temperatures Ts, emits, as well as, receives\nenergy. For a per fect radiator, the net rate of\nloss of radiant energy is\nH = σA (T 4 – Ts\n4)\nFor a body with emissivity e, the relation\nmodifies to\nH = eσ A (T4 – Ts\n4) (10.18)\nAs an example, let us estimate the heat\nradiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area\nof a person’s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room\ntemperature is 22 °C. The internal body\ntemperature, as we know, is about 37 °°C.  The\nskin temperature may be 28° °C (say). The\nemissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the\nrelevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The\nrate of heat loss is:\nH = 5.67 × 10–8 × 1.9 × 0.97 × {(301)4 – (295)4}\n= 66.4 W\nwhich is more than half the rate of energy\nproduction by the body at rest (120 W). To\nprevent this heat loss effectively (better than\nordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has\nan additional thin shiny metallic layer next to\nthe skin, which reflects the body’s radiation.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Thermal Properties of Matter", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "10.9.4", "title": "Blackbody Radiation", "page_start": 17, "page_end": 18, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.18"], "figure_count": 1, "subsection_id": "10.9.4", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.10  NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING\nWe all know that hot water or milk when left on\na table begins to cool, gradually. Ultimately it\nattains the temperature of the surroundings. To\nstudy how slow or fast a given body can cool on\nexchanging heat with its surroundings, let us\nperform the following activity.\nTake some water , say 300 mL, in a\ncalorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a\ntwo-holed lid. Fix the stirrer through one hole\nand fix a thermometer through another hole\nin the lid and make sure that the bulb of\nthermometer is immersed in the water . Note\nthe reading of the ther mometer.

Continue to note the temperatur e\n(T2) of water till it attains a temperature about\n5 °C above that of the surroundings.

You\nwill also notice that initially the rate of cooling\nis higher and decreases as the temperature of\nthe body falls.\nThe above activity shows that a hot body loses\nheat to its surroundings in the form of heat\nradiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on\nthe difference in temperature between the body\nand its surroundings. Newton was the first to\nstudy, in a systematic manner , the r elation\nbetween the heat lost by a body in a given\nenclosure and its temperature.\nAccording to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate\nof loss of heat, – d Q/dt of the body is directly\nproportional to the difference of temperature\n∆T = (T2–T1) of the body and the surroundings.\nThe law holds good only for small difference of\ntemperature.

Heat is a form of energy that flows between a body and its surrounding medium by\nvirtue of temperatur e difference between them. The degr ee of hotness of the body is\nquantitatively r epresented by temperatur e.\n2. A temperature-measuring device (thermometer) makes use of some measurable property\n(called thermometric property) that changes with temperature. Different thermometers\nlead to different temperature scales. To construct a temperature scale, two fixed points\nare chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperatur e. The two numbers fix\nthe origin of the scale and the size of its unit.\n3. The Celsius temperatur e (tC) and the Far enheit temperare (tF)are related by\ntF = (9/5) tC + 32\n4. The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P), volume (V) and absolute temperature (T)\nis :\nPV = µRT\nwhere µ is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.\n5. In the absolute temperature scale, the zero of the scale  corresponds to the temperature\nwhere every substance in nature has the least possible molecular activity. The Kelvin\nabsolute temperature scale ( T ) has the same unit size as the Celsius scale ( Tc ), but\ndiffers in the origin :\nTC   =  T – 273.15\n6.

The relation between them is :\nαv  =  3 αl\n7. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\ns m\nQ\nT= 1 ∆\n∆\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n1 QC Tµ\n∆= ∆\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance.\n8. The latent heat of fusion ( Lf) is the heat per unit mass r equired to change a substance\nfrom solid into liquid at the same temperatur e and pressur e. The latent heat of\nvaporisation (Lv) is the heat per unit mass r equired to change a substance fr om liquid\nto the vapour state without change in the temperatur e and pressure.\n9. The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.\n10. In conduction, heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through\nmolecular collisions, without any flow of matter .

In this chapter we shall study laws that gover n\nthermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is\nconverted into heat and vice versa. In winter , when we rub\nour palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing\nproduces the  ‘heat’.  Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’\nof the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons,\nwhich in turn rotate the wheels of the train.\nIn physics, we need to define the notions of heat,\ntemperature, work, etc. more carefully.  Historically, it took a\nlong time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the\nmodern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid\nfilling in the pores of a substance.  On contact between a hot\nbody and a cold body, the fluid  (called caloric) flowed from\nthe colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens\nwhen a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water\nup to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of\nwater in the two tanks are the same.  Likewise, in the ‘caloric’\npicture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the\ntemperatures) equalise.\nIn time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in\nfavour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An\nimportant experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin\nThomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He\nobserved that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of\nheat, indeed enough to boil water . More significantly, the\namount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the\nhorses employed for turning the drill) but not on the\nsharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill\nwould scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this\nwas not observed. A most natural explanation of the\nobservations was that heat was a form of energy and the\nexperiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form\nto another–from work to heat.\n11.1 Introduction\n11.2 Thermal equilibrium\n11.3 Zeroth law of\nThermodynamics\n11.4 Heat, internal energy and\nwork\n11.5 First law of\nthermodynamics\n11.6 Specific heat capacity\n11.7 Thermodynamic state\nvariables and equation of\nstate\n11.8 Thermodynamic processes\n11.9 Second law of\nthermodynamics\n11.10 Reversible and irreversible\nprocesses\n11.11 Carnot engine", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "11", "chapter_title": "Thermodynamics", "type": "section", "identifier": "11.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "11.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Exercises\nTHERMODYNAMICS 227\nThermodynamics is the branch of physics that\ndeals with the concepts of heat and temperature\nand the inter-conversion of heat and other forms\nof energy. Thermodynamics is a macroscopic\nscience. It deals with bulk systems and does not\ngo into the molecular constitution of matter. In\nfact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the\nnineteenth century before the molecular picture\nof matter was firmly established.  Thermodynamic\ndescription involves relatively few macroscopic\nvariables of the system, which are suggested by\ncommon sense and can be usually measured\ndirectly. A microscopic description of a gas, for\nexample, would involve specifying the co-ordinates\nand velocities of the huge number of molecules\nconstituting the gas. The description in kinetic\ntheory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve\nmolecular distribution of velocities.\nThermodynamic description of a gas, on the other\nhand, avoids the molecular description altogether.\nInstead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is\nspecified by macroscopic variables such as\npressure, volume, temperature, mass and\ncomposition that  are felt by our sense perceptions\nand are measurable*.\nThe distinction between mechanics and\nthermodynamics is worth bearing in mind.  In\nmechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles\nor bodies under the action of forces and torques.\nThermodynamics is not concerned with the\nmotion of the system as a whole.  It is concerned\nwith the internal macroscopic state of the body.\nWhen a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes\nis the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic\nenergy, in particular), not its temperature.

For example, a gas inside a closed\nrigid container, completely insulated fr om its\nsurroundings, with fixed values of pressure,\nvolume, temperature, mass and composition that\ndo not change with time, is in a state of\nthermodynamic equilibrium.\nFig. 11.1 (a) Systems A and B (two gases) separated\nby an adiabatic wall – an insulating wall\nthat does not allow flow of heat.

Temperature is a marker\nof the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the\ndirection of flow of heat when two bodies are\nplaced in thermal contact.  Heat flows from the\nbody at a higher temperature to the one at lower\ntemperature. The flow stops when the\ntemperatures equalise; the two bodies are then\nin thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail\nhow to construct temperature scales to assign\ntemperatures to dif ferent bodies. W e now\ndescribe the concepts of heat and other relevant\nquantities like internal energy and work.\nThe concept of internal energy of a system is\nnot difficult to understand.  We know that every\nbulk system consists of a large number of\nmolecules.  Internal energy is simply the sum of\nthe kinetic energies and potential energies of\nthese molecules. W e remarked earlier that in\nthermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the\nsystem, as a whole, is not relevant.  Internal\nenergy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and\npotential energies in the frame of reference\nrelative to which the centre of mass of the system\nis at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered)\nenergy associated with the random motion of\nmolecules of the system. We denote the internal\nenergy of a system by U.\nThough we have invoked the molecular\npicture to understand the meaning of internal\nenergy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned,\nU is simply a macroscopic variable of the system.\nThe important thing about internal energy is\nthat it depends only on the state of the system,\nnot on how that state was achieved.  Internal\nenergy U of a system is an example of a\nthermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value\ndepends only on the given state of the system,\nnot on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive\nat that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given\nmass of gas depends on its state described by\nspecific values of pressure, volume and\ntemperature. It does not depend on how this\nstate of the gas came about. Pressure, volume,\ntemperature, and internal energy are\nthermodynamic state variables of the system\n(gas) (see section 11.7). If we neglect the small\nintermolecular forces in a gas, the internal\nenergy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies\nassociated with various random motions of its\nmolecules.  We will see in the next chapter that\nin a gas this motion is not only translational\n(i.e. motion from one point to another in the\nvolume of the container); it also includes\nrotational and vibrational motion of the\nmolecules (Fig. 11.3).\nFig. 11.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum\nof the kinetic and potential energies of  its\nmolecules when the box is at rest. Kinetic\nenergy due to various types of motion\n(translational, rotational, vibrational) is to\nbe included in U.  (b) If the same box is\nmoving as a whole with some velocity,\nthe kinetic energy of the box is not to be\nincluded in U.\nFig. 11.4 Heat and work are two distinct modes of\nenergy transfer to a system that results  in\nchange in its internal energy. (a) Heat is\nenergy transfer due to temperature\ndifference between the system and the\nsurroundings.  (b) Work is energy transfer\nbrought about by means (e.g. moving the\npiston by raising or lowering some weight\nconnected to it) that do not involve such a\ntemperature difference.\nPHYSICS230\nWhat are the ways of changing internal\nenergy of a system ? Consider again, for\nsimplicity, the system to be a certain mass of\ngas contained in a cylinder with a movable\npiston as shown in Fig. 11.4.  Experience shows\nthere are two ways of changing the state of the\ngas (and hence its internal energy).  One way is\nto put the cylinder in contact with a body at a\nhigher temperature than that of the gas. The\ntemperature difference will cause a flow of\nenergy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas,\nthus increasing the internal energy of the gas.\nThe other way is to push the piston down i.e. to\ndo work on the system, which again results in\nincreasing the internal energy of the gas.  Of\ncourse, both these things could happen in the\nreverse direction. With surroundings at a lower\ntemperature, heat would flow from the gas to\nthe surroundings.  Likewise, the gas could push\nthe piston up and do work on the surroundings.\nIn short, heat and work are two different modes\nof altering the state of a thermodynamic system\nand changing its internal energy.\nThe notion of heat should be carefully\ndistinguished from the notion of internal energy.\nHeat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in\ntransit.  This is not just a play of words.  The\ndistinction is of basic significance. The state of\na thermodynamic system is characterised by its\ninternal energy, not heat. A statement like ‘a\ngas in a given state has a certain amount of\nheat’ is as meaningless as the statement that\n‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount\nof work’.  In contrast, ‘a gas in a given state\nhas a certain amount of internal energy’ is a\nperfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the\nstatements ‘a certain amount of heat is\nsupplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount\nof work was done by the system’ are perfectly\nmeaningful.\nTo summarise, heat and work in\nthermodynamics are not state variables. They\nare modes of energy transfer to a system\nresulting in change in its internal energy,\nwhich, as already mentioned, is a state variable.\nIn ordinary language, we often confuse heat\nwith internal energy.  The distinction between\nthem is sometimes ignored in elementary\nphysics books. For proper understanding of\nthermodynamics, however , the distinction is\ncrucial.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "11", "chapter_title": "Thermodynamics", "type": "section", "identifier": "11.4", "title": "HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK", "page_start": 4, "page_end": 5, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["11.3", "11.4"], "figure_count": 2, "section_id": "11.4", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "11.5  FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\nWe have seen that the inter nal energy U of a\nsystem can change through two modes of energy\ntransfer : heat and work.  Let\n∆Q = Heat supplied to the system by the\nsurroundings\n∆W = Work done by the system on  the\nsurroundings\n∆U = Change in internal energy of the system\nThe general principle of conservation of\nenergy then implies that\n∆Q =  ∆U + ∆W (11.1)\ni.e. the energy (∆Q) supplied to the system goes\nin partly to increase the internal energy of the\nsystem ( ∆U) and the rest in work on the\nenvironment (∆W). Equation (11.1) is known as\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics.  It is simply\nthe general law of conservation of energy applied\nto any system in which the energy transfer from\nor to the surroundings is taken into account.\nLet us put Eq. (11.1) in the alternative form\n∆Q  – ∆W  = ∆U (11.2)\nNow, the system may go from an initial state\nto the final state in a number of ways. For\nexample, to change the state of a gas from\n(P1, V1) to ( P2, V2), we can first change the\nvolume of the gas from V1 to V2, keeping its\npressure constant i.e. we can first go the state\n(P1, V2) and then change the pressure of the\ngas from P1 to P2, keeping volume constant, to\ntake the gas to ( P2, V2).  Alternatively, we can\nfirst keep the volume constant and then keep\nthe pressure constant. Since U is a state\nvariable, ∆U depends only on the initial and\nfinal states and not on the path taken by the\ngas to go fr om one to the other . However , ∆Q\nand ∆W will, in general, depend on the path\ntaken to go from the initial to final states. From\nthe First Law of Thermodynamics,  Eq. (11.2),\nit is clear that the combination ∆Q – ∆W, is\nhowever, path independent. This shows that\nif a system is taken through a process in which\n∆U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of\nan ideal gas, see section 1 1.8),\n∆Q  = ∆W\ni.e., heat supplied to the system is used up\nentirely by the system in doing work on the\nenvironment.\nTHERMODYNAMICS 231\nIf the system is a gas in a cylinder with a\nmovable piston, the gas in moving the piston does\nwork. Since force is pressure times area, and\narea times displacement is volume, work done\nby the system against a constant pressure P is\n∆W  = P ∆V\nwhere ∆V is the change in volume of the gas.\nThus, for this case, Eq. (11.1) gives\n∆Q  = ∆U + P ∆V (11.3)\nAs an applicatio n of Eq. (11.3), consider the\nchange in internal energy for 1 g of water when\nwe go from its liquid to vapour phase. The\nmeasured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e.,\nfor 1 g of water ∆Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric\npressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm 3 in\nliquid phase and 1671 cm 3 in vapour phase.\nTherefore,\n∆W =P (Vg –Vl ) = 1.013 ×105 × (1671 × 10–6) =169.2 J\nEquation (11.3) then gives\n∆U = 2256 – 169.2  =  2086.8 J\nWe see that most of the heat goes to increase\nthe internal energy of water in transition from\nthe liquid to the vapour phase.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "11", "chapter_title": "Thermodynamics", "type": "section", "identifier": "11.5", "title": "FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS", "page_start": 5, "page_end": 6, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "section_id": "11.5", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "11.6  SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY\nSuppose an amount of heat ∆Q supplied to a\nsubstance changes its temperature from T to\nT + ∆T.

One calorie is defined\nto be the amount of heat required to raise the\ntemperature of 1g of water from 14.5  °C to\n15.5 °C.

The piston will accelerate outward.\nDuring the process, the gas passes through\nstates that are not equilibrium states. The non-\nequilibrium states do not have well-defined\npressure and temperature. In the same way, if\na finite temperature difference exists between\nthe gas and its surroundings, there will be a\nrapid exchange of heat during which the gas\nwill pass through non-equilibrium states.  In\ndue course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium\nstate with well-defined temperature and\npressure equal to those of the surroundings. The\nfree expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture\nof gases undergoing an explosive chemical\nreaction, mentioned in section 11.7 are also\nexamples where the system goes through non-\nequilibrium states.\nNon-equilibrium states of a system are difficult\nto deal with.  It is, therefore, convenient to\nimagine an idealised process in which at every\nstage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a\n* As emphasised earlier, Q is not a state variable.

The\nsystem changes its variables (P, T, V ) so slowly\nthat it remains in thermal and mechanical\nequilibrium with its surroundings throughout.\nIn a quasi-static process, at every stage, the\ndifference in the pressure of the system and the\nexternal pressure is infinitesimally small.  The\nsame is true of the temperature difference\nbetween the system and its surroundings\n(Fig.11.7).  To take a gas from the state (P, T ) to\nanother state (P ′, T ′ ) via  a quasi-static process,\nwe change the external pressure by a very small\namount, allow the system to equalise its pressure\nwith that of the surroundings and continue the\nprocess infinitely slowly until the system\nachieves the pressure P ′. Similarly, to change\nthe temperature, we introduce an infinitesimal\ntemperature difference between the system and\nthe surrounding reservoirs and by choosing\nreservoirs of progressively different temperatures\nT to T ′, the system achieves the temperature T ′.\nFig. 11.7 In a quasi-static process, the temperature\nof the surrounding reservoir and the\nexternal pressure differ only infinitesimally\nfrom the temperature and pressure of the\nsystem.\nA quasi-static process is obviously a\nhypothetical construct.  In practice, processes\nthat are sufficiently slow and do not involve\naccelerated motion of the piston, large\ntemperature gradient, etc., are reasonably\napproximation to an ideal quasi-static process.\nWe shall fr om now on deal with quasi-static\nprocesses only, except when stated otherwise.\nA process in which the temperature of the\nsystem is kept fixed throughout is called an\nisothermal process.  The expansion of a gas in\na metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of\nfixed temperature is an example of an isothermal\nprocess.

Can we reverse this process and bring both\nthe system and surroundings to their initial\nstates with no other effect anywhere? Experience\nsuggests that for most processes in nature this\nis not possible. The spontaneous processes of\nnature are irreversible. Several examples can be\ncited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter\nthan its other parts. When the vessel is removed,\nheat is transferred from the base to the other\nparts, bringing the vessel to a uniform\ntemperature (which in due course cools to the\ntemperature of the surroundings). The process\ncannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not\nget cooler spontaneously and warm up the base.\nIt will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics,\nif it did. The free expansion of a gas is irreversible.\nThe combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol\nand air ignited by a spark cannot be reversed.\nCooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the\nkitchen diffuses to the entire room.

What\nis the maximum efficiency possible for a heat\nengine operating between the two reservoirs and\nwhat cycle of proces ses should be adopted to\nachieve the maximum efficiency ?  Sadi Carnot,\na French engineer, first considered this question\nin 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the\ncorrect answer, even though the basic concepts\nof heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly\nestablished.\nWe expect the ideal engine operating between\ntwo temperatures to be a reversible engine.\nIrreversibility is associated with dissipative\neffects, as remarked in the preceding section,\nand lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if\nit is quasi-static and non-dissipative.  We have\nseen that a process is not quasi-static if it\ninvolves finite temperature difference between\nthe system and the reservoir.  This implies that\nin a reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures, heat should be absorbed\n(from the hot reservoir) isothermally and\nreleased (to the cold reservoir) isothermally.  We\nthus have identified two steps of the reversible\nheat engine : isothermal process at temperature\nT1 absorbing heat Q1 from the hot reservoir, and\nanother isothermal process at temperature T2\nreleasing heat Q2 to the cold r eservoir . T o\ncomplete a cycle, we need to take the system\nfrom temperature T1 to T2 and then back from\ntemperature T2 to T1.  Which processes should\nwe employ for this purpose that are reversible?\nA little reflection shows that we can only adopt\nreversible adiabatic processes for these\npurposes, which involve no heat flow from any\nreservoir. If we employ any other process that is\nnot adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take\nthe system from one temperature to another, we\nshall need a series of reservoirs in the\ntemperature range T2 to T1 to ensure that at each\nstage the process is quasi-static.  (Remember\nagain that for a process to be quasi-static and\nreversible, there should be no finite temperature\ndifference between the system and the reservoir.)\nBut we are considering a reversible engine that\noperates between only two temperatures. Thus\nadiabatic processes must bring about the\ntemperature change in the system from T1 to T2\nand T2 to T1 in this engine.\nFig. 11.9 Carnot cycle for a heat engine with an\nideal gas as  the working substance.\nA reversible heat engine operating between\ntwo temperatures is called a Carnot engine.

Indeed it is the only\nreversible engine possible that works between\ntwo reservoirs at different temperatures.  Each\nstep of the Carnot cycle given in Fig. 11.9 can\nbe reversed. This will amount to taking heat Q2\nfrom the cold reservoir at T2, doing work W on\nthe system, and transferring heat Q1 to the hot\nreservoir. This will be a reversible refrigerator.\nWe next establish the important r esult\n(sometimes called Carnot’s theorem) that\n(a) working between two given temperatures T1\nand T2 of the hot and cold reservoirs respectively,\nno engine can have efficiency more than that of\nthe Carnot engine and (b) the efficiency of the\nCarnot engine is independent of the nature of\nthe working substance.\nTHERMODYNAMICS 239\nTo prove the result (a), imagine a reversible\n(Carnot) engine R and an irreversible engine I\nworking between the same source (hot reservoir)\nand sink (cold reservoir). Let us couple the\nengines, I and R, in such a way so that I acts\nlike a heat engine and R acts as a refrigerator.\nLet I absorb heat Q1 from the source, deliver\nwork W ′ and release the heat Q1- W\n′  to the sink.\nWe arrange so that R returns the same heat Q1\nto the source, taking heat Q2 from the sink and\nrequiring work W = Q1 – Q2 to be done on it.\nNow suppose ηR < ηI i.e. if R were to act\nas an engine it would give less work output\nreservoir and delivers the same amount of  work\nin one cycle, without any change in the source\nor anywhere else. This is clearly against the\nKelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of\nThermodynamics.  Hence the assertion\nηI > ηR\nis wrong.  No engine can have efficiency greater\nthan that of the Carnot engine. A similar\nargument can be constructed to show that a\nreversible engine with one particular substance\ncannot be more efficient than the one using\nanother substance. The maximum efficiency of\na Carnot engine given by Eq. (11.27) is\nindependent of the nature of the system\nperforming the Carnot cycle of operations. Thus\nwe are justified in using an ideal gas as a system\nin the calculation of efficiency η of a Carnot\nengine. The ideal gas has a simple equation of\nstate, which allows us to readily calculate η, but\nthe final result for η, [Eq. (11.27)], is true for\nany Carnot engine.\nThis final remark shows that in a Carnot\ncycle,\n2\n1\n2\n1\nT\nT= Q\nQ\n(11.28)\nis a universal relation independent of  the nature\nof the system.  Here Q1 and Q2 are respectively,\nthe heat absorbed and released isothermally\n(from the hot and to the cold reservoirs) in a\nCarnot engine. Equation (11.28), can, therefore,\nbe used as a relation to define a truly universal\nthermodynamic temperature scale that is\nindependent of any particular properties of the\nsystem used in the Carnot cycle.  Of course, for\nan ideal gas as a working substance, this\nuniversal temperature is the same as the ideal\ngas temperature introduced in section 11.9.\nI\nR\nW\nFig. 11.10 An i rreversible engine (I) coupled to a\nreversible refrigerator (R).

The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a\nthird system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other’.  The Zeroth Law leads\nto the concept of temperature.\n2. Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the\nmolecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over -all kinetic energy of\nthe system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system.  Heat is the\nenergy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the\nsurroundings. Work is energy transfer brought about by other means, such as moving\nthe piston of a cylinder containing the gas, by raising or lowering some weight connected\nto it.\nPHYSICS240\n3. The first law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to\nany system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and\nwork) is taken into account.  It states that\n∆Q  = ∆U  +  ∆W\nwhere ∆Q is the heat supplied to the system, ∆W is the work done by the system and ∆U\nis the change in internal energy of the system.\n4. The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\ns m\nQ\nT= 1 ∆\n∆\nwhere m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its\ntemperature by ∆T.  The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by\n1 QC Tµ\n∆= ∆\nwhere µ is the number  of moles of the substance. For a solid, the law of equipartition\nof energy gives\nC  =  3 R\nwhich generally agrees with experiment at ordinary temperatures.\nCalorie is the old unit of heat. 1 calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the\ntemperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C.  1 cal  =  4.186 J.\n5. For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume\nsatisfy the relation\nCp – Cv  = R\nwhere R is the universal gas constant.\n6. Equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system are described by state variables. The\nvalue of a state variable depends only on the particular state, not on the path used to\narrive at that state.  Examples of state variables are pressure (P ), volume (V ), temperature\n(T ), and mass (m ).  Heat and work are not state variables.  An Equation of State (like\nthe ideal gas equation PV  =\nµ RT ) is a relation connecting dif ferent state variables.\n7. A quasi-static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system remains in\nthermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings throughout. In a\nquasi-static process, the pressure and temperature of the environment can differ from\nthose of the system only infinitesimally.\n8.

The second law of thermodynamics disallows some processes consistent with the First\nLaw of Thermodynamics.

A process is reversible if it can be reversed such that both the system and the surroundings\nreturn to their original states, with no other change anywhere else in the universe.\nSpontaneous processes of nature are irreversible. The idealised reversible process is a\nquasi-static process with no dissipative factors such as friction, viscosity, etc.\n12.

The scientific ‘Atomic\nTheory’  is usually credited to John Dalton. He\nproposed the atomic  theory to explain the laws\nof definite and multiple pr oportions obeyed by\nelements when they combine into compounds.\nThe first law says that any given compound has,\na fixed proportion by mass of its constituents.\nThe second law says that when two elements\nform more than one compound, for a fixed mass\nof one element, the masses of the other elements\nare in ratio of small integers.\nTo explain the laws Dalton suggested, about\n200 years ago,  that the smallest constituents\nof an element are atoms. Atoms of one element\nare identical but dif fer fr om those of other\nelements.  A small number of atoms of each\nelement combine to for m a molecule of the\ncompound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early\n19th century, states:  When gases combine\nchemically to yield another gas, their volumes\nare in the ratios of small integers.  A vogadro’s\nlaw  (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all\ngases at equal temperature and pressure have\nthe same number of molecules.  Avogadro’s law,\nwhen combined with Dalton’s theory explains\nGay  Lussac’s law.  Since the elements are often\nin the form of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory\ncan also be referred to as the molecular theory\nof matter. The theory is now well accepted by\nscientists. However even at the end of the\nnineteenth century there were famous scientists\nwho did not believe in atomic theory !\nFr\nom many observations, in recent times we\nnow know that  molecules (made up of one or\nmor e atoms) constitute matter . Electr on\nmicr oscopes  and scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopes enable us to even see them. The\nsize of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10   m).\nIn solids, which ar e tightly packed, atoms ar e\nspaced about a few  angstr oms (2 Å) apart. In\nliquids the separation between atoms is also\nabout the same.  In liquids the atoms  ar e not\nas rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move\naround. This enables a liquid to flow.  In gases\nthe interatomic distances ar e in tens of\nangstroms.  The average distance a molecule\ncan travel without colliding is called the  mean\nfree path. The mean free path, in gases, is of\nthe order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms\nare much fr eer in gases and can travel long\ndistances without colliding. If they ar e not\nenclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and\nliquids the closeness makes the interatomic force\nimportant. The force has a long range attraction\nand a short range repulsion. The atoms attract\nwhen they are at a few angstroms but repel when\nthey come closer. The static appearance of a gas\nAtomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece\nThough John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in\nancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules.  In the Vaiseshika\nschool of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in\nconsiderable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter.\nIt was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a\nmustard seed and the Meru mountain.  The four kinds of atoms ( Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the\nsmallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic\nmass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and\nwas continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a\ndiatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending\nupon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms.  The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture\nor by methods that are not known to us.  The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the\nBuddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic\nsize, of the order of 10 –10 m.\nIn ancient Gr eece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The\nword ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in\nshape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed\nby their combination.  The atoms of water wer e smooth and r ound and unable to ‘hook’ on to each\nother, which is why liquid /water flows easily.   The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held\ntogether to form hard substances.  The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns.\nThese fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further , perhaps because they\nwere intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the\nhallmark of modern science.\n246 PHYSICS\n( )–1 –1J mol KpV\nTµ\nis misleading. The gas is full of activity and the\nequilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic\nequilibrium, molecules collide and change their\nspeeds during the collision. Only the average\nproperties are constant.\nAtomic theory is not the end of our quest, but\nthe beginning. We now know that atoms are not\nindivisible or elementary. They consist of a\nnucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made\nup of protons and neutr ons. The pr otons and\nneutrons are again made up of quarks. Even\nquarks may not be the end of the story. Ther e\nmay be string like elementary entities.

This is mainly\nbecause in a gas, molecules ar e far from each\nother and their mutual interactions ar e\nnegligible except when two molecules collide.\nGases at low pressures and high temperatures\nmuch above that at which they liquefy (or\nsolidify) approximately satisfy a simple relation\nbetween their pressure, temperature and volume\ngiven by (see Chapter 10)\nPV = KT (12.1)\nfor a given sample of the gas. Here T is the\ntemperature in kelvin or (absolute)  scale. K is  a\nconstant for the given sample but varies with\nthe volume of the gas. If we now  bring in  the\nidea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional\nto the number of molecules, (say) N in the\nsample. We can write K = N k . Observation tells\nus that this k is same for all gases. It is called\nBoltzmann constant and is denoted by k\nB\n.\nAs\n1 1 2 2\n1 1 2 2\nP V P V\nN T N T=  = constant = kB (12.2)\nif P, V and T are same, then N is also same for all\ngases. This is Avogadro’s hypothesis, that  the\nnumber of molecules per unit volume is\nthe same for all gases at a fixed temperature and\npressure. The number in 22.4 litres of any gas\nis 6.02 × 1023. This is known as Avogadro number\nand is denoted by NA. The mass of 22.4 litres of\nany gas is equal to its molecular weight in grams\nat S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K and\npressure 1 atm). This amount of substance is\ncalled a mole (see Chapter 1 for a more precise\ndefinition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of\nnumbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed\ntemperature and pressure from chemical\nreactions.  Kinetic  theory justifies this hypothesis.\nThe perfect gas equation can be written as\nPV =\nµ RT (12.3)\nwhere  µ   is the number of moles and R  = NA\nkB is a universal constant. The temperature T is\nabsolute temperature.  Choosing kelvin scale for\nabsolute temperature, R = 8.314 J mol –1K–1.\nHere\n0 A\nM N\nM Nµ = = (12.4)\nwhere M is the mass of the gas containing N\nmolecules, M0 is the molar mass and NA the\nAvogadro’s number. Using  Eqs. (12.4) and (12.3)\ncan also be written as\nPV = kB NT or P = kB nT\nP (atm)\nFig.12.1 Real gases approach ideal gas behaviour at\nlow pressures and high temperatures.\nwhere  n is the number density, i.e. number of\nmolecules per unit volume. kB is  the Boltzmann\nconstant introduced above. Its value in SI units\nis 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1.\nAnother useful form of Eq. (12.3) is\n0\nRTP M\nρ= (12.5)\nKINETIC THEORY 247\n⊳\nwhere ρ is the mass density of the gas.\nA gas that satisfies Eq. (12.3) exactly at all\npressures and temperatures is defined to be an\nideal gas. An ideal gas is a simple theor etical\nmodel of a gas. No r eal gas is truly ideal.\nFig. 12.1 shows departures from ideal gas\nbehaviour for a r eal gas at thr ee dif ferent\ntemperatures. Notice that all curves appr oach\nthe ideal gas behaviour for low  pr essures and\nhigh temperatures.\nAt low pressur es or high temperatur es the\nmolecules ar e far apart and molecular\ninteractions are negligible. Without interactions\nthe gas behaves like an ideal one.\nIf we fix µ and T in Eq. (12.3), we get\nPV = constant (12.6)\ni.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of\na given mass of gas varies inversely with volume.\nThis is the famous Boyle’s law. Fig. 12.2  shows\ncomparison between experimental P-V curves\nand the theoretical curves predicted by Boyle’s\nlaw. Once again you see that the  agreement is\ngood at high temperatures and  low pressures.\nNext, if you fix P, Eq. (12.1) shows that V ∝  T i.e.,\nfor a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is\nproportional to its absolute temperatur e T\n(Charles’ law). See Fig. 12.3.\nFig.12.2 Experimental P-V curves (solid lines) for\nsteam at three temperatures compared with\nBoyle’s law (dotted lines). P is in units of 22\natm and V in units of 0.09 litres.\nFinally, consider a mixture of non-interacting\nideal  gases:\nµ\n1\nmoles of gas 1, µ\n2\nmoles of gas 2,\netc. in a vessel of volume V at temperature T and\npressure P. It is then found that the equation  of\nstate of the mixture is :\nPV = ( µ1 + µ2 +…  ) RT (12.7)\ni.e. 1 2 ...RT RTP V Vµ µ= + + (12.8)\n= P1 + P2 + … (12.9)\nClearly P1 =    µ1 R T/V   is the pressure that\ngas 1 would  exert at the same conditions of\nvolume and  temperature if no other gases were\npresent. This is called the partial pressure of the\ngas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal\ngases is the sum of partial pr essures. This is\nDalton’s law of partial pressures.\nFig. 12.3 Experimental T-V curves (solid lines) for CO2\nat three pressures compared with Charles’\nlaw (dotted lines).

Take\nthe axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube,\nas shown in Fig. 12.4.  A molecule with velocity\n(vx, v y, v z ) hits the planar wall parallel to yz-\nplane of area A (= l2). Since the collision is elastic,\nthe molecule rebounds with the same velocity;\nits y and z components of velocity do not change\nin the collision but the x-component reverses\nsign. That is, the velocity after collision is\n(-vx, vy, vz ) . The change in momentum of the\nmolecule is:  – mvx – ( mvx) = – 2 mvx . By the\nprinciple of conservation of momentum, the\nmomentum imparted to the wall in the collision\n= 2mvx .\nthe wall. Thus, the number of molecules with\nvelocity (vx, vy, vz )  hitting the wall in time ∆t is\n½A vx  ∆t n, where n is the number of molecules\nper unit volume. The total momentum\ntransferred to the wall by these molecules in\ntime ∆t  is:\nQ = (2mvx) (½ n A vx\n∆t ) (12.10)\nThe force on the wall is the rate of momentum\ntransfer Q/∆t  and pr essure is for ce per unit\narea :\nP =  Q /(A ∆t)  =  n m vx\n2 (12.11)\nActually, all molecules in a gas do not have\nthe same velocity; ther e is a distribution in\nvelocities.  The  above equation, therefore, stands\nfor pressure due to the group of molecules with\nspeed vx  in  the x-direction and n stands for the\nnumber density of that group of molecules.

Thus\nP = (1/3) n m 2v (12.14)\nSome remarks on this derivation. First,\nthough we choose the container to be a cube,\nthe shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For\na vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose\na small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry\nthrough the steps above. Notice that both A and\n∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s\nlaw, given in Ch. 9,  pressure in one portion of\nthe gas  in equilibrium is the same as anywhere\nelse. Second, we have ignored any collisions in\nthe derivation. Though this assumption is\ndifficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively\nsee that it will not lead to erroneous results. The\nnumber of molecules hitting the wall in time ∆t\nwas found to be ½ n Avx ∆t. Now the collisions\nare random and the gas is in a steady state.\nThus, if a molecule with velocity ( vx, v y, v z )\nacquires a  different velocity due to collision with\nsome molecule, there will always be some other\nFig. 12.4 Elastic collision of a gas molecule with the\nwall of the container.\nTo calculate the force (and pressure) on the\nwall, we need to calculate momentum imparted\nto the wall per unit time. In a small time interval\n∆t, a molecule with x-component of velocity vx\nwill hit the wall if it is within the distance vx ∆t\nfrom the wall. That is, all molecules within the\nvolume Avx ∆t only can hit the wall in time ∆t.\nBut, on the average, half of these are moving\ntowards the wall and the other half away from\n250 PHYSICS\n⊳\nmolecule with a different initial velocity which\nafter a collision acquires the velocity  (vx, vy, vz ).\nIf this were not so, the distribution of velocities\nwould not r emain steady.

Motion of a body as a whole fr om one\npoint to another is called translation. Thus, a\nmolecule fr ee to move in space has three\ntranslational degr ees of fr eedom. Each\ntranslational degree of freedom contributes a\nterm that contains square of some variable of\nmotion, e.g., ½ mvx\n2  and similar ter ms in\nvy and vz. In, Eq. (12.24) we see that in thermal\nequilibrium, the average of each such term is\n½ kBT .\nMolecules of a monatomic gas like argon have\nonly translational degrees of freedom. But what\nabout a diatomic gas such as O 2 or N 2? A\nmolecule of O 2 has three translational degrees\nof freedom. But in addition it can also r otate\nabout its centre of mass. Figure 12.6 shows the\ntwo independent axes of rotation 1 and 2, normal\nto the axis joining the two oxygen atoms about\nwhich the molecule can rotate *.

This assumption, though found to be\ntrue (at moderate temperatures) for O 2, is not\nalways valid. Molecules, like CO, even at\nmoderate temperatures have a mode of\nvibration, i.e., its atoms oscillate along the\ninteratomic axis like a one-dimensional\noscillator, and contribute a vibrational ener gy\nterm\nεv to the total energy:\nεv m y\nt ky= \n \n +1\n2\n1\n2\n2\n2d\nd\nt r vε ε ε= + + ε (12.26)\nwhere k is the force constant of the oscillator\nand y the vibrational co-ordinate.\nOnce again the vibrational energy terms in\nEq.

While each translational and\nrotational degree of freedom has contributed only\none ‘squared term’ in Eq.(12.26), one vibrational\nmode contributes two ‘squared terms’ : kinetic\nand potential energies.\nEach quadratic term occurring in the\nexpression for energy is a mode of absorption of\nenergy by the molecule. W e have seen that in\nthermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,\nfor each translational mode of motion, the\naverage energy is ½ kBT. The most elegant\nprinciple of classical statistical mechanics (first\nproved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each\nmode of energy: translational, rotational and\nvibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total\nenergy is equally distributed in all possible\nenergy modes, with each mode having an average\nenergy equal to  ½ kBT. This is known as the law\nof equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each\ntranslational and rotational degree of freedom\nof a molecule contributes ½ kBT  to the energy,\nwhile each vibrational frequency contributes\n2 × ½ kBT  = kBT ,  since a vibrational mode has\nboth kinetic and potential energy modes.\nThe proof of the law of equipartition of energy\nis beyond the scope of this book.

Both these motions are\nnon-repetitive. We have also lear nt about unifor m circular\nmotion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In\nthese cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of\ntime, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have\nenjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both\nthese motions are repetitive in nature but different from the\nperiodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro\nabout a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes\na similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro\nmotion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river , the\npiston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a\nmotion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we\nstudy this motion.\nThe study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its\nconcepts are required for the understanding of many physical\nphenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar\nor the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce\npleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms\nin telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about\ntheir mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make\nthe propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate\nabout their equilibrium positions, the average energy of\nvibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power\nsupply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive\nand negative about the mean value (zero).\nThe description of a periodic motion, in general, and\noscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental\nconcepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude\nand phase. These concepts are developed in the next section.\n13.1 Introduction\n13.2 Periodic and oscillatory\nmotions\n13.3 Simple harmonic motion\n13.4 Simple harmonic motion\nand uniform circular\nmotion\n13.5 Velocity and acceleration\nin simple harmonic motion\n13.6 Force law for simple\nharmonic motion\n13.7 Energy in simple harmonic\nmotion\n13.8 The simple pendulum", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "13", "chapter_title": "Oscillations", "type": "section", "identifier": "13.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "13.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Exercises\nPHYSICS260", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "13", "chapter_title": "Oscillations", "type": "exercises", "identifier": "exercises", "title": "EXERCISES", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 2, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "styling": {"bold": true, "color": "blue", "capital": true}}}, {"content": "13.2 PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS\nFig. 13.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose\nan insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it\ncomes back to the initial point and repeats the\nprocess identically. If you draw a graph of its\nheight above the ground versus time, it would\nlook something like Fig. 13.1 (a). If a child climbs\nup a step, comes down, and repeats the process\nidentically, its height above the ground would\nlook like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the\ngame of bouncing a ball off the ground, between\nyour palm and the ground, its height versus time\ngraph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c).\nNote that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c)\nare sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s\nequation of motion (see section 2.6),\n21\n2 + gth = ut  for downward motion, and\n21\n2 – gth = ut  for upward motion,\nwith different values of u in each case. These\nare examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion\nthat repeats itself at regular intervals of time is\ncalled periodic motion.\nFig. 13.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T\nis shown in each case.\nVery often, the body under going periodic\nmotion has an equilibrium position somewhere\ninside its path. When the body is at this position\nno net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is\nleft there at rest, it remains there forever. If the\nbody is given a small displacement from the\nposition, a force comes into play which tries to\nbring the body back to the equilibrium point,\ngiving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For\nexample, a ball placed in a bowl will be in\nequilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little\nfrom the point, it will perform oscillations in the\nbowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but\nevery periodic motion need not be oscillatory.\nCircular motion is a periodic motion, but it is\nnot oscillatory.\nThere is no significant difference between\noscillations and vibrations. It seems that when\nthe frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,\nthe oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when\nthe frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,\nthe vibration of a string of a musical instrument).\nSimple harmonic motion is the simplest form\nof oscillatory motion. This motion arises when\nthe force on the oscillating body is directly\nproportional to its displacement from the mean\nposition, which is also the equilibrium position.\nFurther, at any point in its oscillation, this force\nis directed towards the mean position.\nIn practice, oscillating bodies eventually\ncome to rest at their equilibrium positions\nbecause of the damping due to friction and other\ndissipative causes.  However, they can be forced\nto remain oscillating by means of some external\nperiodic agency.  We discuss the phenomena of\ndamped and forced oscillations later in the\nchapter.\nAny material medium can be pictured as a\ncollection of a large number of coupled\noscillators. The collective oscillations of the\nconstituents of a medium manifest themselves\nas waves.

For example, in case of rectilinear\nmotion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance\nfrom the starting point as a function of time is\nits position displacement. The choice of origin\nis a matter of convenience. Consider a block\nattached to a spring, the other end of the spring\nis fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.13.2(a)].

The force mg can be\nresolved into the component mg cosθ along the\nstring and mg sinθ perpendicular to it. Since\nthe motion of the bob is along a circle of length\nL and centre at the support point, the bob has\na radial acceleration (ω2L) and also a tangental\nacceleration; the latter arises since motion along\nthe arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial\nacceleration is provided by the net radial force\nT –mg cosθ, while the tangential acceleration is\nprovided by mg sinθ.

Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular\nmotion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.\n5.

The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and\nis always directed towards the centre of motion.\n7. A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy\nK = ½ mv 2  and potential energy U = ½ kx 2.

The period T is the least time after which motion repeats itself.  Thus, motion repeats\nitself after nT where n is an integer.\n2. Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion\ngoverned by the force law F = – k x is simple harmonic.\n3. Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)\nas well as due to simple har monic force in two dimensions equal to: – m\nω2r.  In the\nlatter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ\nby π/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force  – mω2r with initial position (0,\nA) and velocity ( ωA, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.\n4. For linear simple harmonic motion with a given ω, two initial conditions are necessary\nand sufficient to determine the motion completely.  The  initial  conditions may be (i)\ninitial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy\nand phase.\n5. From point 4 above, given  amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the\ninitial position or initial velocity.\n6. A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases\nis not necessarily periodic.  It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral\nmultiple of the other’s frequency.  However, a periodic motion can always be expressed\nas a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.\n7. The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant.\nContrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler’s third law).\n8. The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.\n9. For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement x must be expressible\nin either of the following forms :\nx = A cos\nωt  +  B sin ωt\nx = A cos (ωt + α ), x =  B sin (ωt + β )\nThe three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any\nother two forms).\nThus, damped simple harmonic motion is not strictly simple harmonic.

What happens in a system, which is\na collection of such objects? A material medium provides\nsuch an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents\nto each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of\nthe other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water,\nthe water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not\nremain confined to one place, but propagates outward along\na circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you\nsee circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the\nwater surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is\nmoving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put\nsome cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that\nthe cork pieces move up and down but do not move away\nfrom the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water\nmass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a\nmoving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,\nthe sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air\nfrom one part of the medium to another . The disturbances\nproduced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or\na microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move\nwithout the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a\nwhole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such\nwaves.\nWaves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has\ninformation that propagate from one point to another. All our\ncommunications essentially depend on transmission of sig-\nnals through waves. Speech means production of sound\nwaves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often,\ncommunication involves different kinds of waves.

Detection of the original signal will usu-\nally involve these steps in reverse order.\nNot all waves require a medium for their\npropagation. W e know that light waves can\ntravel through vacuum. The light emitted by\nstars, which are hundreds of light years away,\nreaches us through inter -stellar space, which\nis practically a vacuum.\nThe most familiar type of waves such as waves\non a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic\nwaves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves.\nThese waves require a medium for propagation,\nthey cannot propagate through vacuum. They\ninvolve oscillations of constituent particles and\ndepend on the elastic properties of the medium.\nThe electromagnetic waves that you will learn\nin Class XII are a different type of wave.\nElectromagnetic waves do not necessarily require\na medium - they can travel through vacuum.\nLight, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic\nwaves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves\nhave the same speed c, whose value is :\nc = 299, 792, 458 ms–1. (14.1)\nA third kind of wave is the so-called Matter\nwaves. They are associated with constituents of\nmatter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and\nmolecules. They arise in quantum mechanical\ndescription of nature that you will learn in your\nlater studies. Though conceptually more abstract\nthan mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they\nhave already found applications in several\ndevices basic to modern technology; matter\nwaves associated with electrons are employed\nin electron microscopes.\nIn this chapter we will study mechanical\nwaves, which require a material medium for\ntheir propagation.\nThe aesthetic influence of waves on art and\nliterature is seen from very early times; yet the\nfirst scientific analysis of wave motion dates back\nto the seventeenth century. Some of the famous\nscientists associated with the physics of wave\nmotion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695),\nRobert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The\nunderstanding of physics of waves followed the\nphysics of oscillations of masses tied to springs\nand physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in\nelastic media are intimately connected with\nharmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled\nsprings, air, etc., are examples of elastic media).\nWe shall illustrate this connection thr ough\nsimple examples.\nConsider a collection of springs connected to\none another as shown in Fig. 14.1. If the spring\nat one end is pulled suddenly and released, the\ndisturbance travels to the other end. What has\nhappened? The first spring is disturbed from its\nequilibrium length. Since the second spring is\nconnected to the first, it is also stretched or\ncompressed, and so on. The disturbance moves\nfrom one end to the other; but each spring only\nexecutes small oscillations about its equilibrium\nposition. As a practical example of this situation,\nconsider a stationary train at a railway station.\nDifferent bogies of the train are coupled to each\nother through a spring coupling. When an\nengine is attached at one end, it gives a push to\nthe bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from\none bogie to another without the entire train\nbeing bodily displaced.\nNow let us consider the propagation of sound\nwaves in air. As the wave passes through air, it\ncompresses or expands a small region of air. This\ncauses a change in the density of that region,\nsay\nδρ, this change induces a change in pressure,\nδp, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area,\nso there is a restoring force proportional to\nthe disturbance, just like in a spring. In this\ncase, the quantity similar to extension or\ncompression of the spring is the change in\ndensity. If a region is compressed, the molecules\nin that region are packed together, and they tend\nto move out to the adjoining region, thereby\nincreasing the density or creating compression\nin the adjoining region. Consequently, the air\nin the fir st region undergoes rarefaction. If a\nregion is comparatively rarefied the surrounding\nair will rush in making the rarefaction move to\nthe adjoining region. Thus, the compression or\nrarefaction moves fr om one region to another,\nmaking the propagation of a disturbance\npossible in air.\nFig. 14.1 A collection of springs connected to each\nother . The end A is pulled suddenly\ngenerating a disturbance, which then\npropagates to the other end.\nPHYSICS280\nIn solids, similar arguments can be made. In\na crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are\narranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each\natom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to\nforces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing\none atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to\nrestoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we\ncan think of atoms in a lattice as end points,\nwith springs between pairs of them.\nIn the subsequent sections of this chapter\nwe are going to discuss various characteristic\nproperties of waves.", "metadata": {"class": "11", "chapter": "14", "chapter_title": "Waves", "type": "exercises", "identifier": "exercises", "title": "EXERCISES", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 3, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["14.1"], "figure_count": 1, "styling": {"bold": true, "color": "blue", "capital": true}}}, {"content": "14.2 TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL\nWAVES\nWe have seen that motion of mechanical waves\ninvolves oscillations of constituents of the\nmedium. If the constituents of the medium\noscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a transverse wave.\nIf they oscillate along the direction of wave\npropagation, we call the wave a longitudinal\nwave.\nFig.14.2 shows the propagation of a single\npulse along a string, resulting from a single up\nand down jerk. If the string is very long compared\nposition as the pulse or wave passes through\nthem. The oscillations are normal to the\ndirection of wave motion along the string, so this\nis an example of transverse wave.\nWe can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix\nan instant of time and picture the wave in space.\nThis will give us the shape of the wave as a\nwhole in space at a given instant. Another way\nis to fix a location i.e. fix our attention on a\nparticular element of string and see its\noscillatory motion in time.\nFig. 14.4 describes the situation for\nlongitudinal waves in the most familiar example\nof the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe\nfilled with air has a piston at one end. A single\nsudden push forward and pull back of the piston\nwill generate a pulse of condensations (higher\ndensity) and rarefactions (lower density) in the\nmedium (air). If the  push-pull of the piston is\ncontinuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a\nFig. 14.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling\nalong a stretched string is an example of a\ntransverse wave. An element of the string\nin the region of the wave oscillates about\nits equilibrium position perpendicular to the\ndirection of wave propagation.\nFig. 14.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a\nstretched string (x-direction), the elements\nof the string oscillate up and down (y-\ndirection)\nto the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out\nbefore it reaches the other end and reflection\nfrom that end may be ignored. Fig. 14.3 shows a\nsimilar situation, but this time the external\nagent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up\nand down jerk to one end of the string. The\nresulting disturbance on the string is then a\nsinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of\nthe string oscillate about their equilibrium mean\nFig. 14.4 Longitudinal waves (sound) generated in a\npipe filled with air by moving the piston up\nand down. A volume element of air oscillates\nin the direction parallel to the direction of\nwave propagation.\nWAVES 281\nsinusoidal wave will be generated propagating\nin air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly\nan example of longitudinal waves.\nThe waves considered above, transverse or\nlongitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves\nsince they travel from one part of the medium\nto another. The material medium as a whole\ndoes not move, as already noted. A stream, for\nexample, constitutes motion of water as a whole.\nIn a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves,\nnot water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion\nof air as a whole) should not be confused with a\nsound wave which is a propagation of\ndisturbance (in pressure density) in air, without\nthe motion of air medium as a whole.\nIn transverse waves, the particle motion is\nnormal to the direction of propagation of the\nwave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each\nelement of the medium undergoes a shearing\nstrain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be\npropagated only in those media, which can\nsustain shearing stress, such as solids and not\nin fluids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain\ncompressive strain; therefore, longitudinal\nwaves can be propagated in all elastic media.\nFor example, in medium like steel, both\ntransverse and longitudinal waves can\npropagate, while air can sustain only\nlongitudinal waves. The waves on the surface\nof water are of two kinds: capillary waves and\ngravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly\nshort wavelength —not more than a few\ncentimetre —and the restoring force that\nproduces them is the surface tension of water.\nGravity waves have wavelengths typically\nranging from several metres to several hundred\nmeters. The restoring force that produces these\nwaves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep\nthe water surface at its lowest level. The\noscillations of the particles in these waves are\nnot confined to the surface only, but extend with\ndiminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The\nparticle motion in water waves involves a\ncomplicated motion—they not only move up and\ndown but also back and forth. The waves in an\nocean are the combination of both longitudinal\nand transverse waves.\nIt is found that, generally, transverse and\nlongitudinal waves travel with different speed\nin the same medium.\nuuu\nuu Example  14.1  Given below are some\nexamples of wave motion.

Such a function at every instant should\ngive the shape of the wave at that instant. Also,\nat every given location, it should describe the\nmotion of the constituent of the medium at that\nlocation. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal\ntravelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig.\n14.3) the corresponding function must also be\nsinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the\nwave to be transverse so that if the position of\nthe constituents of the medium is denoted by x,\nthe displacement from the equilibrium position\nmay be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling\nwave is then described by:\n( , ) sin( ) = − ω + φy x t a kx t (14.2)\nThe term φ in the argument of sine function\nmeans equivalently that we are considering a\nlinear combination of sine and cosine functions:\n( , ) sin( ) cos( )y x t A kx t B kx t ω ω= − + − (14.3)\nFrom Equations (14.2) and (14.3),\n2 2a A B= +  and  1tanφ −= B\nA\n\n \n\nTo understand why Equation (14.2)\nrepresents a sinusoidal travelling wave, take a\nfixed instant,  say t = t0.

Similarly, take a fixed location, say x = x0.\nThen, the argument of the sine function in\nEquation (14.2) is constant - ωt. The\ndisplacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies\nsinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents\nof the medium at different positions execute\nsimple harmonic motion. Finally, as t increases,\nx must increase in the positive direction to keep\nkx –\nωt + φ  constant. Thus, Eq. (14.2) represents\na sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along\nthe positive direction of the x-axis. On the other\nhand, a function\n( , ) sin( ) = + ω + φy x t a kx t  (14.4)\nrepresents a wave travelling in the negative\ndirection of x-axis.

To see how a wave travels, we\ncan fix attention on a crest and see how it\nprogresses with time. In the figure, this is\nshown by a cross (×) on the crest. In the same\nmanner, we can see the motion of a particular\nconstituent of the medium at a fixed location,\nsay at the origin of the x-axis. This is shown\nby a solid dot (•) . The plots of Fig. 1 4.6 show\nthat with time, the solid dot (•) at the origin\nmoves periodically , i.e. , the particle at the\norigin oscillates about its mean position as\nthe wave progresses.

Assuming there is no absorption of\nenergy by the boundary, the reflected wave has\nthe same shape as the incident pulse but it\nsuffers a phase change of π or 1800 on reflection.\nThis is because the boundary is rigid and the\ndisturbance must have zero displacement at all\ntimes at the boundary. By the principle of\nsuperposition, this is possible only if the reflected\nand incident waves differ by a phase of π, so that\nthe resultant displacement is zero. This\nreasoning is based on boundary condition on a\nrigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion\ndynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall,\nit exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third\nLaw, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force\non the string generating a reflected pulse that\ndiffers by a phase of π.\nFig. 14.11 Reflection of a pulse meeting a rigid\nboundary.\nPHYSICS290\n= a [sin (kx – ωt) + sin (kx + ωt)]\nUsing the familiar trignometric identity\nSin (A+B) + Sin (A–B) = 2 sin A cosB we get,\ny (x, t) = 2a sin kx cos ωt (14.37)\nNote the important difference in the wave\npattern described by Eq. (14.37) from that\ndescribed by Eq. (14.2) or Eq. (14.4). The terms\nkx and\nωt appear separately, not in the\ncombination kx - ωt. The amplitude of this wave\nis 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the\namplitude varies from point-to-point, but each\nelement of the string oscillates with the same\nangular frequency\nω or time period. There is no\nphase difference between oscillations of different\nelements of the wave. The string as a whole\nvibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at\ndifferent points. The wave pattern is neither\nmoving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they\nare called standing or stationary waves. The\namplitude is fixed at a given location but, as\nremarked earlier , it is dif ferent at dif ferent\nlocations. The points at which the amplitude is\nzero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are\nnodes; the points at which the amplitude is the\nlargest are called antinodes. Fig. 14.12 shows\na stationary wave pattern resulting from\nsuperposition of two travelling waves in\nopposite directions.\nThe most significant feature of stationary\nwaves is that the boundary conditions constrain\nthe possible wavelengths or frequencies of\nvibration of the system. The system cannot\noscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast\nthis with a harmonic travelling wave), but is\ncharacterised by a set of natural frequencies or\nnormal modes of oscillation. Let us determine\nthese normal modes for a stretched string fixed\nat both ends.\nFirst, from Eq. (14.37), the positions of nodes\n(where the amplitude is zero) are given by\nsin kx = 0 .\nwhich implies\nkx = n\nπ;   n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nSince, k = 2π/λ , we get\nx =\nλ\n2\nn\n; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...        (14.38)\nFig. 14.12 Stationary waves arising from superposition of two harmonic waves travelling in opposite directions.\nNote that the positions of zero displacement (nodes) remain fixed at all times.\nWAVES 291\nClearly, the distance between any two\nsuccessive nodes is\nλ\n2 . In the same way, the\npositions of antinodes (where the amplitude is\nthe largest) are given by the largest value of sin\nkx :\nsin k x = 1\nwhich implies\nkx = (n + ½)\nπ ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\nWith k = 2π/λ, we get\nx = (n + ½)2\nλ  ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...                (14.39)\nAgain the distance between any two consecutive\nantinodes is 2\nλ . Eq. (14.38) can be applied to\nthe case of a stretched string of\nlength L fixed at both ends. Taking\none end to be at x = 0, the boundary\nconditions are that x = 0 and x = L\nare positions of nodes. The x = 0\ncondition is already satisfied. The\nx = L node condition requires that\nthe length L is related to λ by\nL = n\n2\nλ ;     n = 1, 2, 3, ...        (14.40)\nThus, the possible wavelengths of\nstationary waves are constrained\nby the relation\nλ  = 2L\nn\n;    n = 1, 2, 3, …   (14.41)\nwith corresponding frequencies\nv =\n2L\nnv , for  n = 1, 2, 3,   (14.42)\nWe have thus obtained the natural\nfrequencies - the normal modes of\noscillation of the system. The lowest\npossible natural frequency of a\nsystem is called its fundamental\nmode or the first harmonic. For the\nstretched string fixed at either end\nit is given by v =\nv\nL2 , corresponding\nto n = 1 of Eq. (14.42). Here v is the\nspeed of wave determined by the properties of\nthe medium. The n = 2 frequency is called the\nsecond harmonic; n = 3 is the third harmonic\nand so on. We can label the various harmonics by\nthe symbol νn ( n = 1, 2, ...).\nFig. 14.13 shows the first six harmonics of a\nstretched string fixed at either end. A string\nneed not vibrate in one of these modes only.\nGenerally, the vibration of a string will be a\nsuperposition of different modes; some modes\nmay be more strongly excited and some less.\nMusical instruments like sitar or violin are\nbased on this principle. Where the string is\nplucked or bowed, determines which modes are\nmore prominent than others.\nLet us next consider normal modes of\noscillation of an air column with one end closed\nFig. 14.13  The first six harmonics of vibrations of a stretched\nstring fixed at both ends.\nPHYSICS292\nand the other open. A glass tube partially filled\nwith water illustrates this system. The end in\ncontact with water is a node, while the open end\nis an antinode. At the node the pressure\nchanges are the largest, while the displacement\nis minimum (zero). At the open end - the\nantinode, it is just the other way - least pressure\nchange and maximum amplitude of\ndisplacement. Taking the end in contact with\nwater to be x = 0, the node condition (Eq. 14.38)\nis already satisfied. If the other end x = L is an\nantinode, Eq. (14.39) gives\nL =\nn +\n \n\n1\n2  2\nλ , for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, …\nThe possible wavelengths are then restricted by\nthe relation :\nλ  =\n( )\n2\n1 2\nL\nn  + /\n,  for n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...

The higher frequencies\nare odd harmonics, i.e., odd multiples  of the\nfundamental frequency : 3 v\nL4\n, 5 v\nL4\n, etc.\nFig. 14.14 shows the first six odd harmonics of\nair column with one end closed and the other\nopen. For a pipe open at both ends, each end is\nan antinode. It is then easily seen that an open\nair column at both ends generates all harmonics\n(See Fig. 14.15).\nThe systems above, strings and air columns,\ncan also undergo forced oscillations (Chapter\n13). If the external frequency is close to one of\nthe natural frequencies, the system shows\nresonance.\nNormal modes of a circular membrane rigidly\nclamped to the circumference as in a tabla are\ndetermined by the boundary condition that no\npoint on the circumference of the membrane\nvibrates.

Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.\n2. Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular\nto the direction of wave propagation.\n3. Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the\ndirection of wave propagation.\n4. Progressive wave is a wave that moves fr om one point of medium to another .\n5. The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given\nby\ny (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt + φ)\nwhere a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular\nfrequency, (kx – ωt + φ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.\n6. Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of\nthe same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between\ntwo  consecutive nodes or antinodes.\n7. Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium\ntakes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω\nthrough the relation\nT = 2π\nω\n8. Frequency v of a wave is defined as 1/T and is related to angular frequency by\n2\nων = π\n9. Speed of a progressive wave is given by\nk Tv ω λ λν= = =\n10.  The speed of a transverse wave  on a stretched string is set by the properties of the\nstring.

When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the\ndisplacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements\ndue to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves\n1\n(   )\nn\ni\ni\ny f x vt\n=\n= −∑\n13. Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling\naccording to the principle of superposition.

We also experience a sensation of an electric\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\ndue to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with\nthe study of forces, fields and potentials arising from\nstatic charges .", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "1", "chapter_title": "Electric Charges and Fields", "type": "section", "identifier": "1.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 1, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "1.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "1.2  ELECTRIC CHARGE\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\naround 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word\n2\nPhysics\nelektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which\non rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of\npapers.\nIt was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth\nare brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The\ntwo strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were\nrubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted\neach other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each\nother [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic\nrod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with\nwhich the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur.\nThese seemingly simple facts  were established from years of efforts\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\nan entry which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\nan electric charge on rubbing. There are two kinds of electrification and\nwe find  that (i) like charges repel  and (ii) unlike charges attract each\nother. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called\nthe polarity of charge.\nWhen a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\nno longer attract each other. They also do not attract or repel other light\nobjects as they did on being electrified.\nThus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named\nas positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin.\nBy convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and\nthat on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an\nelectric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge\nit is said to be electrically neutral.\nFIGURE 1.1 Rods: like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n3\nA simple apparatus to detect charge  on a body  is the gold-leaf\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\nthe amount of charge.\nTry to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that\nall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the\nmaterials are electrically neutral,  they do contain charges; but their charges\nare exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that\nhold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated\nwith surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the\nforces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and\nit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is\ntherefore essential that we learn more about such a force.\nTo electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids,  some of the electrons, being\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\nfrom one body to the other.  A body can thus be charged positively by\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\nby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\nmaterial body.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "1", "chapter_title": "Electric Charges and Fields", "type": "section", "identifier": "1.2", "title": "ELECTRIC CHARGE", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 3, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["1.1", "1.2"], "figure_count": 2, "section_id": "1.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "1.3  CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others\ndo not.  Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are\ncalled conductors . They have electric charges (electrons) that are\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\nbodies and earth are conductors. Most of the non-metals like glass,\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators. Most  substances\nfall into one of the two classes stated above*.\nWhen some char ge is transferr ed to a conductor , it r eadily gets\ndistributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some\ncharge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn\nwhy this happens in the next chapter.\nThis property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\n* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\ninsulators.\n4\nPhysics\nlike spoon does not.

Thus charge q on a body is always\ngiven by\nq = ne\nwhere n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is\nthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\nwritten as –e and that on a proton as +e.\nThe fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\nMillikan in 1912.\nIn the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\nsubsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge\nflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\nbasic unit of charge is\ne = 1.602192 × 10 –19 C\nThus, there are about 6 × 10 18 electrons in a charge of  –1C. In\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered\nand hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C.\nIf the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the\nuniverse, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e.\nThus, if a body contains n1 electrons and n2 protons, the total amount\nof charge on the body is n2 × e + n1 × (–e) = (n 2 – n1) e. Since n1 and n2\nare integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any\nbody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or\ndecreased also in steps of e.\nThe step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible. In this respect,\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous.\nThis situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\n6\nPhysics\nEXAMPLE 1.2  EXAMPLE 1.1\neach other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution.\nAt the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\nof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\npractical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\nof e, i.e.,  they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored.

Therefore\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C.\nThe time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10 –10 C/s) = 6.25 × 10 9 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365  × 24 ×\n3600) years = 198 years.

When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges. Coulomb measured the\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n7\nacted along the line joining the two charges . Thus, if two\npoint charges q1, q2 are separated by a distance r in vacuum,\nthe magnitude of the force (F) between them is given by\n21\n2\nq qF k\nr\n= (1.1)\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments?\nCoulomb used a torsion balance*  for measuring the force\nbetween two charged metallic spheres. When the separation\nbetween two spheres is much larger than the radius of each\nsphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges.\nHowever, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin\nwith. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)?\nCoulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the\ncharge on a metallic sphere is q. If the sphere is put in contact\nwith an identical uncharged sphere, the charge will spread over\nthe two spheres. By symmetry, the charge on each sphere will\nbe q/2*. Repeating this process, we can get charges q/2, q/4,\netc. Coulomb varied the distance for a fixed pair of charges and\nmeasured the force for different separations. He then varied the\ncharges in pairs, keeping the distance fixed for each pair .\nComparing forces for different pairs of charges at different\ndistances, Coulomb arrived at the relation, Eq. (1.1).\nCoulomb’s law, a simple mathematical statement,  was\ninitially experimentally arrived at  in the manner described\nabove. While the original experiments established it at a\nmacroscopic scale, it has also been established down to\nsubatomic level  (r ~ 10–10 m).\nCoulomb discovered his law without knowing the explicit\nmagnitude of the charge. In fact, it is the other way round:\nCoulomb’s law can now be employed to furnish a definition\nfor a unit of charge. In the relation, Eq. (1.1), k is so far\narbitrary. We can choose any positive value of k. The choice\nof k determines the size of the unit of charge. In SI units, the\nvalue of k is about 9 × 10 9\n2\n2\nNm\nC . The unit of charge that\nresults from this choice is called a coulomb which we defined\nearlier in Section 1.4. Putting this value of k in Eq. (1.1), we\nsee that for q1 = q2 = 1 C, r = 1 m\nF = 9 × 109 N\nThat is, 1 C is the charge that when placed at a distance\nof 1 m from another charge of the same magnitude in vacuum\nexperiences an electrical force of repulsion of magnitude\n* A torsion balance is a sensitive device to measure force. It was also used later\nby Cavendish to measure the very feeble gravitational force between two objects,\nto verify Newton’s Law of Gravitation.\n* Implicit in this is the assumption of additivity of charges and conservation:\ntwo charges (q/2 each) add up to make a total charge  q.\nCharles Augustin de\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\nCoulomb, a French\nphysicist, began his\ncareer as a military\nengineer in the W est\nIndies. In 1776, he\nreturned to Paris and\nretired to a small estate\nto do his scientific\nresearch. He invented a\ntorsion balance to\nmeasure the quantity of\na force and used it for\ndetermination of forces\nof electric attraction or\nrepulsion between small\ncharged spheres. He\nthus arrived in 1785 at\nthe inverse square law\nrelation, now known as\nCoulomb’s law. The law\nhad been anticipated by\nPriestley and also by\nCavendish earlier ,\nthough Cavendish\nnever published his\nresults. Coulomb also\nfound the inverse\nsquare law of force\nbetween unlike and like\nmagnetic poles.\nCHARLES AUGUSTIN DE COULOMB  (1736 –1806)\n8\nPhysics\n9 × 109 N. One coulomb is evidently too big a unit to\nbe used. In practice, in electrostatics, one uses\nsmaller units like 1 mC or 1 mC.\nThe constant k in Eq.

If we\nplace another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q\nwill exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\nnothing? If ther e is nothing at the point P , then how does a for ce act\nwhen we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding.\nWhen another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on\nit and produces a force.

The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position.

Thus,\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*.\nSome important remarks may be made here:\n(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\nelectric field due to a charge  Q at a point in space may be defined\nas the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\n* An alternate unit V/m will be intr oduced in the next chapter .\nFIGURE 1.8 Electric\nfield (a) due to a\ncharge Q, (b) due to a\ncharge –Q.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n15\nat that point. The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\ncalled a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\nsource charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q\nmust remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought\nat any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\nE F= \n\n\n→\nlim\nq q0\n(1.9)\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces!\nThis may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice.\nWhen we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\ninside the sheet.\n(ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in\nterms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\nthe space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over\nthe space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\nevery point in three-dimensional space.\n(iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\nnegative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards.\n(iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude\nof its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E\ndue to\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "1", "chapter_title": "Electric Charges and Fields", "type": "section", "identifier": "1.7", "title": "ELECTRIC FIELD", "page_start": 14, "page_end": 15, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "section_id": "1.7", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "1.7.1  Electric field due to a system of charges\nConsider a system of charges q1, q2, ..., q n with  position vectors r1,\nr2, ..., rn relative  to some origin O.

After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\nintermediate quantity called the electric field?\nFor electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity.\nThe true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\nbetween two distant charges q1, q2 in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\nis c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q1 on q2 cannot\nFIGURE 1.9 Electric field at a point\ndue to a system of charges is the\nvector sum of the electric fields at\nthe point due to individual charges.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n17\narise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect\n(force on q2) and the cause (motion of q1). It is precisely here that the\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\nuseful. The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q 1\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\nc, reach q2 and cause a force on q2. The notion of field elegantly accounts\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\nindependent dynamics of their own,  i.e., they evolve according to laws\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\ntransporting energy.

It is a vector quantity\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\nradially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture.  In\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\nthat arrow.  Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\nand the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\nthe charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge,\nthe field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\nresulting in well-separated lines.\nAnother person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region.\nFIGURE 1.12 Field of a point charge.\nEXAMPLE 1.8\n20\nPhysics\nIt is the relative density of lines in different regions which is\nimportant.\nWe draw the figur e on the plane of paper , i.e., in two-\ndimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\nto the lines.  Since the electric field decreases as the square of\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge.\nWe started by saying that the field lines carry information\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space.\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\nlines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\nwhere it is weak. Figure 1.13 shows a set of field lines. We\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S.\nTo understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions.\nRecall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\ntransverse line element Dl be placed at a distance\nr from a point O. Then\nthe angle subtended by Dl  at O can be appr oximated as Dq = Dl/r.\nLikewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle * subtended by a small\nperpendicular plane ar ea DS, at a distance r, can be written as\nDW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P1 and P2 at distances\nr1 and r2 from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\nDW is 2\n1r DW at P1 and an element of area 2\n2r DW at P2, respectively. The\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/( 2\n1r DW) at\nP1 and n/( 2\n2r DW) at P2, respectively. Since n and DW are common, the\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/r 2 dependence.\nThe picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\nappropriate ter m is field lines  (electric or magnetic) that we have\nadopted in this book.\nElectric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,\nFIGURE 1.13  Dependence of\nelectric field strength on the\ndistance and its relation to the\nnumber of field lines.\n* Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone\nwith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equal\nto DS/R\n2\n, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n21\na curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each\npoint is in the direction of the net field at that point. An\narrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the\ndirection of electric field from the two possible directions\nindicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space\ncurve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions.\nFigure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple\ncharge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines\nare in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them\nonly in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge\nare radially outward while those of a single negative\ncharge are radially inward. The field lines around a system\nof two positive charges ( q, q) give a vivid pictorial\ndescription of their mutual repulsion, while those around\nthe configuration of two equal and opposite charges\n(q, – q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction\nbetween the charges. The field lines follow some important\ngeneral properties:\n(i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at\nnegative charges. If there is a single charge, they may\nstart or end at infinity.\n(ii) In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken\nto be continuous curves without any breaks.\n(iii) Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did,\nthe field at the point of intersection will not have a\nunique direction, which is absurd.)\n(iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops.\nThis follows from the conservative nature of electric\nfield (Chapter 2).", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "1", "chapter_title": "Electric Charges and Fields", "type": "section", "identifier": "1.8", "title": "ELECTRIC FIELD LINES", "page_start": 19, "page_end": 21, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["1.13"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "1.8", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "1.9  ELECTRIC FLUX\nConsider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small\nflat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\narea per unit time  v dS and represents the flux of liquid\nflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is\nnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v, but\nmakes an angle\nq with it, the projected area in a plane\nperpendicular to v is δ dS cos q. Therefore, the flux going\nout of the surface dS is v. ˆn dS. For the case of  the electric\nfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric\nflux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a\nphysically observable quantity unlike the case of\nliquid flow.\nIn the picture of electric field lines described above,\nwe saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,\nplaced normal to the field at a point is a measure of the\nstrength of electric field at that point. This means that if\nFIGURE 1.14 Field lines due to\nsome simple charge configurations.\n22\nPhysics\nwe place a small planar element of area DS\nnormal to E at a point, the number of field lines\ncrossing it is proportional * to E DS. Now\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle q.\nClearly, the number of field lines crossing the\narea element will be smaller. The projection of\nthe area element normal to E is DS cosq. Thus,\nthe number of field lines crossing DS is\nproportional to E DS cosq. When q = 90°, field\nlines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it\nat all (Fig. 1.15).\nThe orientation of area element and not\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\norientation. This shows that an area element\nshould be tr eated as a vector . It has a\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal.\nHow to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements.\nEach small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\nwith it, as explained before.\nNotice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element?\nThis problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple.\nThe vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\nto be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used\nin Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed\nsurface equals DS\nˆn  where DS is the magnitude of the area element and\nˆn  is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point.\nWe now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through\nan area element DS is defined by\nDf = E.DS = E DS  cosq (1.11)\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\nthe area element. The angle\nq here is the angle between E and DS. For a\nclosed surface, with the convention stated already, q is the angle between\nE and the outward normal   to the area element. Notice we could look at\nthe expression E DS cosq  in two ways:  E ( DS cosq ) i.e., E times the\nFIGURE 1.15 Dependence of flux on the\ninclination q between E and ˆn .\nFIGURE 1.16\nConvention for\ndefining normal\nˆn  and DS. * It will not be proper to say that the number of field lines is equal to E DS. The\nnumber of field lines is after all, a matter of how many field lines we choose to\ndraw. What is physically significant is the relative number of field lines crossing\na given area at different points.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n23\nprojection of area normal to E,  or E^ DS, i.e., component of E along the\nnormal to the area element times the magnitude of the area element. The\nunit of electric flux is N C–1 m2.\nThe basic definition of electric flux given by Eq. (1.11) can be used, in\nprinciple, to calculate the total flux through any given surface. All we\nhave to do is to divide the surface into small area elements, calculate the\nflux at each element and add them up. Thus, the total flux\nf through a\nsurface S is\nf ~ S E.DS (1.12)\nThe approximation sign is put because the electric field E is taken to\nbe constant over the small area element.

Thus,\nt tt tt  = p × E (1.22)\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero.\nWhat happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\non the dipole if E is not uniform.\nFigure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\nwith respect to E.\nThis brings us to a common observation in frictional\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\npaper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains\nthe attractive force? Taking the clue from the preceding\nFIGURE 1.19 Dipole in a\nuniform electric field.\nFIGURE 1.20 Electric force on a\ndipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b)  E\nantiparallel to p.\n28\nPhysics\ndiscussion, the charged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper, i.e., induces\na net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field\ndue to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a\ndipole to experience a net force on it.

One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\nmany purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\nexample, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\nconstituents. It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\nspecify the charge DQ on that element. We then define a surface charge\ndensity\ns at the area element by\nQ\nSσ Δ= Δ (1.23)\nWe can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at\na continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface\ncharge density s  so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. s  represents\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\nunits for\ns are C/m2.\nSimilar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\ncharge distribution. The linear charge density l of a wire is defined by\nQ\nlλ Δ= Δ (1.24)\nwhere Dl is a small line element of wire on the macroscopic scale that,\nhowever, includes a large number of microscopic charged constituents,\nand DQ is the charge contained in that line element. The units for l are\nC/m. The volume charge density (sometimes simply called charge density)\nis defined in a similar manner:\nQ\nVρ Δ= Δ (1.25)\nwhere DQ is the charge included in the macroscopically small volume\nelement DV that includes a large number of microscopic charged\nconstituents. The units for r are C/m3.\nThe notion of continuous charge distribution is similar to that we\nadopt for continuous mass distribution in mechanics. When we refer to\nFIGURE 1.21\nDefinition of linear ,\nsurface and volume\ncharge densities.\nIn each case, the\nelement ( Dl, DS, DV)\nchosen is small on\nthe macroscopic\nscale but contains\na very large number\nof microscopic\nconstituents.\n* At the microscopic level, charge distribution is discontinuous, because they are\ndiscrete charges separated by intervening space where there is no charge.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n29\nthe density of a liquid, we are referring to its macroscopic density. We\nregard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular\nconstitution.\nThe field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in\nmuch the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose\na continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density\nr. Choose\nany convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the\ncharge distribution be r. The charge density\nr may vary from point to\npoint, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the charge distribution into small\nvolume elements of size DV. The charge in a volume element DV is rDV.\nNow, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)\nwith position vector R (Fig. 1.21).

Thus,\n2\n2\n00\n44\nq qrrφ εε= × π =π (1.30)\nEquation (1.30) is a simple illustration of a general result of\nelectrostatics called Gauss’s law.\nWe state Gauss’s law without proof:\nElectric flux through a closed surface S\n= q/e0 (1.31)\nq = total charge enclosed by S.\nThe law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is\nzero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23.\nHere the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total\nflux f  through the surface is  f = f1 + f2 + f3, where f1 and f2 represent\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\ncylinder and f3 is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, f3 = 0. Further, the outward\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E.\nTherefore,\nf1 = –E S1,     f2 = +E S2\nS1 = S2 = S\nwhere S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\ncontained in the closed surface is zero.\nThe great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\nus note some important points regarding this law:\n(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\nor size.\n(ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\nanywhere inside the surface.\n(iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\noutside S. The ter m q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however ,\nrepresents only the total charge inside S.\nFIGURE 1.23 Calculation of the\nflux of uniform electric field\nthrough the sur face of a cylinder .\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n31\nEXAMPLE 1.10\n(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called\nthe Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian sur face and\napply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\nany bound.) However , the Gaussian sur face can pass thr ough a\ncontinuous charge distribution.\n(v) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry.  This is\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface.\n(vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\ndistance contained in the Coulomb’s law.

Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,\nmolecules and bulk matter.\n2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that\nthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel\nand unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod\nrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is\nthen negative.\n3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,\ninsulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in\nelectrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile.\n4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\nand conservation.\nQuantisation of electric charge means that total charge ( q) of a body\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge ( e) i.e.,\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\nnumber, quantisation of charge can be ignored.\nAdditivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\nof all individual charges in the system.\nConservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\n38\nPhysics\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\nfr om one body to another , but no cr eation or destruction\nof charge.\n5. Coulomb’s Law : The mutual electrostatic force between two point\ncharges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance r21 separating them.\nMathematically,\nF21 = force on q2 due to\n1 2\n1 212\n21\nˆk (q q )q r= r\nwhere 21ˆr  is a unit vector in the direction from q1 to q2 and k =\n0\n1\n4 επ\nis the constant of proportionality.\nIn SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of\nthe constant e0 is\ne0 = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2\nThe approximate value of k is\nk = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2\n6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton\nand an electron is\n2\n392 4 10\ne p\nk e .G m m ≅ ×\n7. Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the\nforces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not\naffected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For\nan assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is\nthe vector sum of the force on  q1 due to q2, the force on q1 due to q3,\nand so on. For each pair , the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for\ntwo charges stated earlier.\n8. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the\nforce on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by\nthe magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has\na magnitude |q|/4pe0r2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,\nand radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field\nalso satisfies superposition principle.\n9. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent\nat each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that\npoint. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength\nof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions\nof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is\nweak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly\nspaced parallel straight lines.\n10. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are\ncontinuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross\neach other. (iii) Electr ostatic field lines start at positive char ges and\nend at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops.\n11. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and – q\nseparated by some distance 2 a. Its dipole moment vector p  has\nmagnitude 2qa and is in the direction o f the dipole axis from – q to q.\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n39\n12.

In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque τ  given by\nτ  = p × E\nbut experiences no net force.\n14. The flux Df of electric field E through a small area element DS is\ngiven by\nDf  = E.DS\nThe vector area element DS is\nDS = DS ˆn\nwhere DS is the magnitude of the area element and ˆn  is normal to the\narea element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small DS.\nFor an area element of a closed surface, ˆn  is taken to be the direction\nof outward normal, by convention.\n15. Gauss’s law: The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is\n1/e0 times the total charge enclosed by S. The law is especially useful\nin determining electric field E, when the source distribution has simple\nsymmetry:\n(i) Thin infinitely long straight wire of uniform linear charge density l\n0\nˆ\n2 r\nλ\nε= πE n\nwhere r is the perpendicular distance of the point from the wire and\nˆn is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point.\n(ii) Infinite thin plane sheet of uniform surface charge density\ns\n0\nˆ\n2\nσ\nε=E n\nwhere ˆn  is a unit vector normal to the plane, outward on either side.\n40\nPhysics\n(iii) Thin spherical shell of uniform surface charge density s\n2\n0\nˆ ( )4\nq r Rrε= ≥πE r\nE = 0      ( r   <   R)\nwhere r is the distance of the point from the centre of the shell and R\nthe radius of the shell. q is the total charge of the shell:  q = 4pR2s.\nThe electric field outside the shell is as though the total charge is\nconcentrated at the centre. The same result is true for a solid sphere\nof uniform volume charge density. The field is zero at all points inside\nthe shell.\nPhysical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarks\nVector ar ea element D S [L2] m2 DS = DS ˆn\nElectric field E [MLT–3A–1] V m–1\nElectric flux f [ML3 T–3A–1] V m Df  =  E.DS\nDipole moment p [LTA] C m Vector  directed\nfrom negative  to\npositive  charge\nCharge density:\nlinear l [L–1 TA] C m–1  Charge/length\nsurface s [L–2 TA] C m–2 Charge/area\nvolume r [L–3 TA] C m–3 Charge/volume", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "1", "chapter_title": "Electric Charges and Fields", "type": "summary", "identifier": "summary", "title": "SUMMARY", "page_start": 37, "page_end": 40, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true}}, {"content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1. You might wonder why the pr otons, all carrying positive char ges,\nare compactly residing inside the nucleus.

The range of\ndistance wher e this for ce is ef fective is, however , very small ~10 -14\nm. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are\nnot allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,\ndue to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their\nstructure as they exist in na ture.\n2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square\nlaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n41\nCoulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing\npossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite\nbeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive\nforce in nature.\n3. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI\nunits, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic\neffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\nby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is\napproximately 9 × 10 9 N m2 C–2.\n4. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge\n(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as\nmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of\nmagnetic forces (forces on  current–carrying wires) which are generally\nmuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit\nof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for\nelectric effects.\n5. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related\nto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;\ncharge is a scalar.\n6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also\ninvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always\ntrue for every scalar . For example, kinetic ener gy is a scalar under\nrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative\nmotion.\n7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property\nindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.\nConservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference.\nA quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an\ninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector\nquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system).\n8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;\ninterestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass.\n9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or\nequated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:\nforce on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the\npresence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,\nfour -body, etc., for ces which arise only when ther e are mor e than\ntwo charges.\n10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined\nat the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume\ncharge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution.\nFor a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous\nacross the surfac e.\n11. The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero\nis not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of\nthe configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/ r 2, typical of field\ndue to a single charge.

For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0.\nTwo remarks may be made here. First, we assume\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\nR to P, we apply an external force Fext just enough to\ncounter the repulsive electric force FE (i.e, Fext= –FE).\nThis means there is no net force on or acceleration of\nthe charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved.\nThus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\nWRP =\n=    –  (2.1)\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\nas potential energy.\nAt every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\nR and P.\nThus, potential energy difference\nP R RPU U U WΔ = − = (2.2)\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –WRP .)\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving\n(without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field\nof any arbitrary charge configuration.\nTwo important comments may be made at this stage:\n(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions\nof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\none point to the other . This is the fundamental characteristic of a\nconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be\nmeaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence\nof work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the\nCoulomb’s law. We omit this proof here.\nFIGURE 2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is\nmoved from the point R to the\npoint P against the repulsive\nforce on it by the charge Q (> 0)\nplaced at the origin.\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n47\n(ii) Equation (2.2) defines potential energy difference in terms\nof the physically meaningful quantity work . Clearly,\npotential energy so defined is undetermined to within an\nadditive constant.What this means is that the actual value\nof potential energy is not physically significant; it is only\nthe difference of potential energy that is significant. We can\nalways add an arbitrary constant\na to potential energy at\nevery point, since this will not change the potential energy\ndifference:\n( ) ( )P R P RU U U Uα α+ − + = −\nPut it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point\nwhere potential energy is zero.

In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question.\nWhat is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question\nwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic\npotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7.\nThe main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\nenergy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\ncalculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\npotential V due to the exter nal sources. We assume that the char ge q\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge\nq\n(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field.\nThe external electric field E and the corresponding external potential\nV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work\ndone in bringing a unit positive char ge from infinity to the point P .\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n59\nEXAMPLE 2.5\n(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zero.) Thus, work done in\nbringing a charge q from infinity to the point P in the external field is qV.\nThis work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has\nposition vector r relative to some origin, we can write:\nPotential energy of q at r in an external field\n= qV(r) (2.27)\nwhere V(r) is the external potential at the point r.\nThus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated by\na potential difference of DV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qDV = 1.6 ×\n10–19J.

In metallic conductors, these\ncharge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons\npart away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free\nwithin the metal but not free  to leave the metal. The free electrons form a\nkind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move\nrandomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift\nagainst the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei\nand the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic\nconductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but\nPhysics\n62\nthe situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge\ncarriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the\nso-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion\nto metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding\nelectrostatics of conductors.\n1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero\nConsider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external\nelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside\nor on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere\ninside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a\nconductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\nconductor .\n2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the\nsurface of a char ged conductor must be nor mal to the sur face at every\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\neven at the surface.) See result 5.\n3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\nthe static situation\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation.\nThis follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\nv inside a conductor . On the closed sur face S bounding the volume\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\ninside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface.\n4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\nits surface\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above. Since E = 0 inside the conductor\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That\nis, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on\nthe surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n63\nelectric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be\ndifferent for the surface and a point just outside the surface.\nIn a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and\ncharge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant\nvalue of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to\nthe other.\n5. Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor\n0\nˆσ\nε=E n (2.35)\nwhere s is the surface charge density and ˆn  is a unit vector normal\nto the surface in the outward direction.\nTo derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian\nsurface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pill\nbox is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It\nhas a small area of cross section d S and negligible height.\nJust inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the\nfield is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,\nthe contribution to the total flux through the pill box\ncomes only from the outside (circular) cross-section\nof the pill box. This equals  ± E\ndS (positive for s > 0,\nnegative for s < 0), since over the small area  dS, E\nmay be considered constant and E and dS are parallel\nor antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box\nis  sdS.\nBy Gauss’s law\nEdS =\n0\nSσ δ\nε\nE =\n0\nσ\nε (2.36)\nIncluding the fact that electric field is normal to the\nsurface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (2.35), which\nis true for both signs of s. For s > 0, electric field is\nnormal to the surface outward; for s < 0, electric field\nis normal to the surface inward.\n6. Electrostatic shielding\nConsider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A\nremarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever\nbe the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the\nconductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have\nproved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged\nspherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of\nthe spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of\nelectric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned\nabove, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor\nFIGURE 2.17  The Gaussian surface\n(a pill box) chosen to derive Eq. (2.35)\nfor electric field at the surface of a\ncharged conductor .\nPhysics\n64\nEXAMPLE 2.7\nFIGURE 2.18 The electric field inside a\ncavity of any conductor is zero. All\ncharges reside only on the outer surface\nof a conductor with cavity. (There are no\ncharges placed in the cavity.)\nis charged or charges are induced on a neutral\nconductor by an external field, all charges reside\nonly on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.\nThe proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are\nomitted here, but we note their important\nimplication. Whatever be the charge and field\nconfiguration outside, any cavity in a conductor\nremains shielded from outside electric influence: the\nfield inside the cavity is always zero. This is known\nas electrostatic shielding. The effect can be made\nuse of in protecting sensitive instruments from\noutside electrical influence.

In contrast to conductors,\nthey have no (or negligible number of ) charge carriers. Recall from Section\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\nmolecules of the dielectric. The collective effect of all\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\nhowever, the opposing field so induced does not\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it.\nThe extent of the effect depends on the\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\neffect, we need to look at the charge\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\nmolecular level.\nThe molecules of a substance may be\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\nmoment. Examples of non-polar molecules\nare oxygen (O 2) and hydrogen (H 2)\nmolecules which, because of their\nsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On the\nother hand, a polar molecule is one in which\nthe centres of positive and negative charges\nare separated (even when there is no\nexternal field). Such molecules have a\npermanent dipole moment. An ionic\nmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water\n(H2O) are examples of polar molecules.\nFIGURE 2.20  Difference in behaviour\nof a conductor and a dielectric\nin an external electric field.\nFIGURE 2.21 Some examples of polar\nand non-polar molecules.\nPhysics\n66\nIn an external electric field, the\npositive and negative charges of a non-\npolar molecule are displaced in opposite\ndirections. The displacement stops when\nthe external force on the constituent\ncharges of the molecule is balanced by\nthe restoring force (due to internal fields\nin the molecule). The non-polar molecule\nthus develops an induced dipole moment.\nThe dielectric is said to be polarised by\nthe external field. We consider only the\nsimple situation when the induced dipole\nmoment is in the direction of the field and\nis proportional to the field strength.\n(Substances for which this assumption\nis true are called linear isotropic\ndielectrics.) The induced dipole moments\nof different molecules add up giving a net\ndipole moment of the dielectric in the\npresence of the external field.\nA dielectric with polar molecules also\ndevelops a net dipole moment in an\nexternal field, but for a different reason.\nIn the absence of any external field, the\ndifferent permanent dipoles are oriented\nrandomly due to thermal agitation; so\nthe total dipole moment is zero. When\nan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend  to align\nwith the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net\ndipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is\npolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of\ntwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external\nfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending\nto disrupt the alignment. There may be, in addition, the  ‘induced dipole\nmoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment\neffect is more important for polar molecules.\nThus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops\na net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole\nmoment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P. For\nlinear isotropic dielectrics,\n0ε χ=P E e (2.37)\nwhere ce is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the\nelectric susceptibility of the dielectric medium.\nIt is possible to relate ce to the molecular properties of the substance,\nbut we shall not pursue that here.\nThe question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original\nexternal field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular\ndielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E0 parallel to two of its\nfaces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric. Thus\nFIGURE 2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipole\nmoment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar\nmolecules, (b) Polar molecules.\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n67\nevery volume element Dv of the slab has a dipole moment\nP Dv in the direction of the field. The volume element Dv  is\nmacroscopically small but contains a very large number of\nmolecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the\nvolume element Dv\nhas no net charge (though it has net\ndipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one\ndipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole.\nHowever, at the sur faces of the dielectric nor mal to the\nelectric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen\nin Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain\nunneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at\nthe left surface.

The conductors have charges, say Q1 and Q2, and potentials\nV1 and V2. Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q\nand – Q, with potential difference V = V1 – V2 between them. We shall\nconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a\nsingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at\ninfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the\ntwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though\nthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge  of\nthe capacitor  is zero.\nThe electric field in the region between the\nconductors is proportional to the charge Q. That\nis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say  doubled,\nthe electric field will also be doubled at every point.\n(This follows from the direct proportionality\nbetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle.) Now,\npotential difference V is the work done per unit\npositive charge in taking a small test charge from\nthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field.\nConsequently, V is also proportional to Q, and the\nratio Q/V is a constant:\nQC V= (2.38)\nThe constant C is called the capacitance of the capacitor. C is independent\nof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on the\nFIGURE 2.23 A uniformly\npolarised dielectric amounts\nto induced surface charge\ndensity, but no volume\ncharge density.\nFIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors\nseparated by an insulator for ms a capacitor .\nPhysics\n68\ngeometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two\nconductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.]  The SI unit of\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V–1. A capacitor\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as ---||---, while the one with\nvariable capacitance is shown as\n.\nEquation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\nQ at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\nintervening medium.\nThe maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\nstrength; for air it is about 3 × 10 6 Vm –1. For a separation between\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\ndifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to\nstore a large amount of charge without  leaking, its capacitance should\nbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric\nfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "2", "chapter_title": "Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance", "type": "section", "identifier": "2.11", "title": "CAPACITORS AND CAPACITANCE", "page_start": 23, "page_end": 24, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["2.24"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "2.11", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "2.12  THE PARALLEL PLATE CAPACITOR\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25).

Its\ncapacitance is defined by C = Q/V, where Q and –Q are the charges on the\ntwo conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is\ndetermined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative\npositions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,\n1 F = 1 C V –1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the\nplates),\nC =\n0\nA\ndε\nwhere A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them.\n10. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating\nsubstance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces\na net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,\ngives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside\nthe dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is\nthus reduced. Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value\nC0 when there is no medium (vacuum),\nC = KC0\nwhere K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance.\n11. For capacitors in the series combination, the total capacitance C is given by\n1 2 3\n1 1 1 1 ...C C C C= + + +\nIn the parallel combination, the total capacitance C is:\nC =  C1 + C2 + C3 + ...\nwhere C1, C2, C3... are individual capacitances.\nPhysics\n78\n12.

Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a\nforce on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of\nelectrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each\ncharge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the\nnet Coulomb force on the charge.\n2. A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within\na small region of space.

If it is\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\nionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively char ged\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\ngram of water, for example, contains approximately 1022 molecules. These\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\nto individual nuclei. In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied.\nIf we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\ncharged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move.\nIn our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\nof fixed positive ions.\nConsider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\nas before the collision. However , the direction of its velocity after the\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\nCurrent\nElectricity\n83\nnumber of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\nelectric current.\nLet us now see what happens to such a\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied.\nTo focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1).\nSuppose we now take two thin circular discs\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc\nand similarly –Q at the other disc. We attach\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and\nis directed from the positive towards the\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\ncurrent thereafter.\nWe can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\nstudy  later in this chapter. In the next sections, we shall study the steady\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "3", "chapter_title": "Current Electricity", "type": "section", "identifier": "3.3", "title": "ELECTRIC CURRENTS IN CONDUCTORS", "page_start": 2, "page_end": 3, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["3.1"], "figure_count": 1, "section_id": "3.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "3.4  OHM’S LAW\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor.\nThen Ohm’s law states that\nV µ I\nor, V = R I (3.3)\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\nW. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows.\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the  combination is the\nsame as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is\nFIGURE 3.1 Charges + Q and – Q put at the ends\nof a metallic cylinder . The electr ons will drift\nbecause of the electric field created to\nneutralise the charges.

The potential difference across the ends of the\ncombination is clearly sum of the potential difference\nacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V. The\ncurrent through the combination is I and the resistance\nof the combination RC is [from Eq. (3.3)],\n2 2C\nVR R I= = (3.4)\nsince V/I = R, the resistance of either of the slabs. Thus,\ndoubling the length of a conductor doubles the\nresistance. In general, then resistance is proportional to\nlength,\nR l∝ (3.5)\nNext, imagine dividing the slab into two by cutting it\nlengthwise so that the slab can be considered as a\ncombination of two identical slabs of length l, but each\nhaving a cross sectional  area of A/2 [Fig. 3.2(c)].\nFor a given voltage V across the slab, if I is the current\nthrough the entire slab, then clearly the current flowing\nthrough each of the two half-slabs is I/2. Since the\npotential difference across the ends of the half-slabs is V,\ni.e., the same as across the full slab, the resistance of each\nof the half-slabs R1 is\n1 2 2 .( /2)\nV VR RI I= = = (3.6)\nThus, halving the area of the cross-section of a conductor doubles\nthe resistance. In general, then the resistance R is inversely proportional\nto the cross-sectional area,\n1R A∝ (3.7)\nCombining Eqs. (3.5) and (3.7), we have\nlR A∝ (3.8)\nand hence for a given conductor\nlR Aρ= (3.9)\nwhere the constant of proportionality r depends on the material of the\nconductor but not on its dimensions. r is called resistivity.\nUsing the last equation, Ohm’s law reads\nI lV I R A\nρ= × = (3.10)\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called\ncurrent density and is denoted by j.

The current density, (which we have defined as the current\nthrough unit area normal to the current) is also directed along E, and is\nalso a vector j (º ºº ºº j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,\nE = jr (3.12)\nor,   j = s E (3.13)\nwhere s º1/r is called the conductivity. Ohm’s law is often stated in an\nequivalent form, Eq.

It tells us that the\nelectrons move with an average velocity which is\nindependent of time, although electrons are\naccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the\nvelocity vd in Eq.

Consider\na planar area A, located inside the conductor such that\nthe normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then\nbecause of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time\nDt, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto\n|vd|Dt would have crossed the area.

This is\nbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During\ncollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms.\nThe atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,\nin an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the\nconductor during the time interval Dt is,\nDW = I VDt (3.31)\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated\nP = DW/Dt  and we have,\nP = I V (3.32)\nCurrent\nElectricity\n93\nUsing Ohm’s law V = IR, we get\nP = I 2 R = V 2/R (3.33)\nas the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a\ncurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an\nelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light.\nWhere does the power come from? As we have\nreasoned before, we need an external source to keep\na steady current through the conductor. It is clearly\nthis source which must supply this power . In the\nsimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the\nchemical energy of the cell which supplies this power\nfor as long as it can.\nThe expressions for power, Eqs. (3.32) and (3.33),\nshow the dependence of the power dissipated in a\nresistor R on the current through it and the voltage\nacross it.\nEquation (3.33) has an important application to\npower transmission. Electrical power is transmitted\nfrom power stations to homes and factories, which\nmay be hundreds of miles away, via transmission\ncables. One obviously wants to minimise the power\nloss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes\nand factories. We shall  see now how this can be achieved. Consider a\ndevice R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cables\nhaving a resistance Rc to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltage\nacross R and I the current through it, then\nP = V I (3.34)\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\nresistance Rc.

Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The  transmission cables\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance Rc is\nconsiderable. To reduce Pc, these wires carry current at enormous values\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas.

The energy\ndissipated in the resistor R comes from\nthe chemical energy of the electrolyte.\nPhysics\n94\nFig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in\nthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte.\nThe positive electrode has a potential difference V+ (V+ > 0) between\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\npotential  – (V– ) (V– ≥  0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V+ – (–V–) = V+ + V– . This difference is called the\nelectromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus\ne = V++V– >  0 (3.36)\nNote that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The\nname emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly.\nTo understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R\nfrom C to D. As explained before, a steady current is maintained\nbecause current flows from N to P through the electrolyte. Clearly,\nacross the electrolyte the same current flows through the electrolyte\nbut from N to P, whereas through R, it flows from P to N.\nThe electrolyte through which a current flows has a finite\nresistance r, called the internal r esistance.

Now,\nV = Potential difference between P and A\n+ Potential difference between A and B\n+ Potential  difference between B and N\n=\ne (3.37)\nThus, emf e is the potential difference between the positive and\nnegative electrodes in an open circuit, i.e., when no current is\nflowing through the cell.\nIf however R is finite, I is not zero.

The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\nresistance of dry cells, however , is much higher than the common\nelectrolytic cells.\nWe also observe that since V is the potential difference across R, we\nhave from Ohm’s law\nV = I  R (3.39)\nCombining Eqs.

Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules,\nare very useful for analysis of electric circuits.\nGiven a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\nthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) =\ne – I r\n[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I\nhere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course\nV =\ne + I r (3.60)\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:\n(a) Junction rule:  At any junction, the sum of the currents entering\nthe junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction\n(Fig. 3.15).\nGustav Robert Kirchhoff\n(1824 – 1887)  German\nphysicist, professor at\nHeidelberg and at\nBerlin. Mainly known for\nhis development of\nspectroscopy, he also\nmade many important\ncontributions to mathe-\nmatical physics, among\nthem, his first and\nsecond rules for circuits.\nGUSTAV ROBERT KIRCHHOFF (1824 –\nPhysics\n98\nEXAMPLE 3.5\nThis applies equally well if instead of a junction of\nseveral lines, we consider a point in a line.\nThe proof of this rule follows from the fact that\nwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulation\nof charges at any junction or at any point in a line.\nThus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate\nat which charge flows into the junction), must equal\nthe total current flowing out.\n(b) Loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in\npotential around any closed loop involving\nresistors and cells in the loop is zero\n(Fig. 3.15).\nThis rule is also obvious, since electric potential is\ndependent on the location of the point. Thus\nstarting with any point if we come back to the same\npoint, the total change must be zero. In a closed\nloop, we do come back to the starting point and\nhence the rule.\nFIGURE 3.15 At junction a the current\nleaving is I1 + I2 and current entering is I3.\nThe junction rule says I3 = I1 + I2. At point\nh current entering is I1. There is only one\ncurrent leaving h and by junction rule\nthat will also be I1.

Current through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing\nper unit time through the area.\n2. To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit.\n3. Ohm’s law : The electric current I flowing through a substance is\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V µ I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance\nis ohm: 1W = 1 V A –1.\nCurrent\nElectricity\n103\n4. The resistance  R of a conductor depends on its length l and\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\nlR A\nρ=\nwhere r, called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on\ntemperature and pressure.\n5. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10 –8 W m to 10 –6 W m. Insulators\nlike glass and rubber have 10 22 to 10 24 times greater resistivity.\nSemiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale.\n6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\nnegative ions carry the electric current.\n7. Current density j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\nunit area normal to the flow,\nj = nq vd\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\ncarriers each of charge q, and vd is the drift velocity  of the charge\ncarriers. For electrons  q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\nthe area is nevd A.\n8.

However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\nrealised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration\nin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed\nthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby\nmagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found\nthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which\nhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the\nwire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the\ncurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the\nearth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the\ncurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection\nincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the\nwire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in\nconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted\nconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field\nin the surrounding space .\nFollowing this, there was intense experimentation.

Ampere\nwas a child prodigy\nwho mastered advanced\nmathematics by the age of\n12. Ampere grasped the\nsignificance of Oersted’s\ndiscovery. He carried out a\nlarge series of experiments\nto explore the relationship\nbetween current electricity\nand magnetism. These\ninvestigations culminated\nin 1827 with the\npublication of the\n‘Mathematical Theory of\nElectrodynamic Pheno-\nmena Deduced Solely from\nExperiments’. He hypo-\nthesised that all magnetic\nphenomena are due to\ncirculating electric\ncurrents. Ampere was\nhumble and absent-\nminded. He once forgot an\ninvitation to dine with the\nEmperor Napoleon. He died\nof pneumonia at the age of\n61. His gravestone bears\nthe epitaph: Tandem Feli x\n(Happy at last).\n(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of\nradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in\nmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field\n119\nMoving Charges and\nMagnetism\nEXAMPLE 4.7\npossesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The field that\nnormally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r.\nWhenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify.\n(ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it.\nThus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form\nconcentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form\nconcentric circles. These lines called magnetic field lines form closed\nloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate\nfrom positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression\nfor the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical\njustification to Oersted’s experiments.\n(iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is\ninfinite, the field due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. It\ntends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The\nfield is directly proportional to the current and inversely\nproportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source.\n(iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic\nfield due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:\nGrasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing\nin the dir ection of the curr ent. Your fingers will curl ar ound in the\ndirection of the magnetic field.\nAmpere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law.\nBoth relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same\nphysical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to\nBiot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s\nand Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary\n(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,\nin the interior (current or charge).

Further, we have learnt that an external magnetic field\nwill exert a force on a current-carrying conductor. This\nfollows from the Lorentz force formula. Thus, it is logical\nto expect that two current-carrying conductors placed near\neach other will exert (magnetic) forces on each other. In\nthe period 1820-25, Ampere studied the nature of this\nmagnetic force and its dependence on the magnitude of\nthe current, on the shape and size of the conductors, as\nwell as, the distances between the conductors. In this\nsection, we shall take the simple example of two parallel\ncurrent- carrying conductors, which will perhaps help us\nto appreciate Ampere’s painstaking work.\n123\nMoving Charges and\nMagnetism\nFigure 4.17 shows two long parallel conductors a and b separated\nby a distance d and carrying (parallel) currents Ia and Ib, respectively.\nThe conductor ‘a’ produces,  the same magnetic field Ba at all points\nalong the conductor ‘b’.

The direction of this force is towards the\nconductor ‘a’ (Verify this). We label this force as Fba, the force on a\nsegment L of ‘b’ due to ‘a’. The magnitude of this force is given by\nEq. (4.4),\n=ba b aF I LB\nµ\nπ= 0\n2\na bI I Ld (4.17)\nIt is of course possible to compute the force on ‘a’ due to ‘b’. From\nconsiderations similar to above we can find the force Fab, on a segment of\nlength L of ‘a’ due to the current in ‘b’. It  is equal in magnitude to Fba,\nand directed towards ‘b’. Thus,\nFba = –Fab (4.18)\nNote that this is consistent with Newton’s third Law. Thus, at least for\nparallel conductors and steady currents, we have shown that the\nBiot-Savart law and the Lorentz force yield results in accordance with\nNewton’s third Law*.\nWe have seen from above that currents flowing in the same direction\nattract each other. One can show that oppositely directed currents repel\neach other. Thus,\nParallel currents attract, and antiparallel currents repel.\nThis rule is the opposite of what we find in electrostatics. Like (same\nsign) charges repel each other, but like (parallel) currents attract each other.\nLet fba represent the magnitude of the force Fba per unit length. Then,\nfrom Eq.

An essential consequence of the Newton’s third law in mechanics\nis conservation of momentum of an isolated system.

This is\nillustrated in Fig. 4.18(a).\nThe field exerts no force on the two arms AD and BC\nof the loop.

Its magnitude is,\nF1 = I b B\nSimilarly, it exerts a force F2 on the arm CD and F2\nis directed out of the plane of the paper.\nF2 = I b B = F1\nThus, the net force on the loop is zero. There is a\ntorque on the loop due to the pair of forces F1 and F2.\nFigure 4.18(b) shows a view of the loop from the AD\nend. It shows that the torque on the loop tends to rotate\nit anticlockwise.

We take the angle between the field and the normal to\nthe coil to be angle θ (The previous case corresponds to\nθ = π/2). Figure 4.19 illustrates this general case.\nThe forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along\nthe axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA.\nBeing collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net\nforce or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F1 and F2. They too\nare equal and opposite, with magnitude,\nF1 = F2 = I b B\nBut they are not collinear!  This results in a couple as before.

But how do we measure them? How do we claim that\ncurrent in a circuit is 1.5 A or the voltage drop across a resistor is 1.2 V?\nFigure 4.20 exhibits a very useful instrument for this purpose: the moving\ncoil galvanometer (MCG). It is a device whose principle can be understood\non the basis of our discussion in Section 4.9.\nThe galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns, free to rotate\nabout a fixed axis (Fig. 4.20), in a uniform radial magnetic field. There is\na cylindrical soft iron core which not only makes the field radial but also\nincreases the strength of the magnetic field.  When a current flows through\nthe coil, a torque acts on it. This torque is given by Eq. (4.20) to be\nτ = NI AB\nPhysics\n130\nwhere the symbols have their usual meaning. Since\nthe field is radial by design, we have taken sin θ = 1 in\nthe above expression for the torque. The magnetic\ntorque NIAB tends to rotate the coil. A spring S p\nprovides a counter torque k\nφ that balances the\nmagnetic torque NIAB; resulting in a steady angular\ndeflection φ. In equilibrium\nkφ = NI AB\nwhere k is the torsional constant of the spring; i.e. the\nrestoring torque per unit twist. The deflection φ is\nindicated on the scale by a pointer attached to the\nspring. We have\nφ = \n \n\nNAB\nk I (4.26)\nThe quantity in brackets is a constant for a given\ngalvanometer.\nThe galvanometer can be used in a number of ways.\nIt can be used as a detector to check if a current is\nflowing in the circuit. We have come across this usage\nin the Wheatstone’s bridge arrangement. In this usage\nthe neutral position of the pointer (when no current is\nflowing through the galvanometer) is in the middle of\nthe scale and not at the left end as shown in Fig.4.20.\nDepending on the direction of the current, the pointer’s\ndeflection is either to the right or the left.\nThe galvanometer cannot as such be used as an\nammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for\ntwo reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-\nscale deflection for a current of the order of\nµA. (ii) For measuring currents,\nthe galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large\nresistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To\novercome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance rs, called shunt\nresistance, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the\ncurrent passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,\nRG rs / (RG  + rs)   ≃  rs         if    RG >>  rs\nIf rs has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the\ncircuit Rc, the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small\nand negligible. This arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.21.\nThe scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off\nthe current value with ease. We define the current sensitivity of the\ngalvanometer as the deflection per unit current . From Eq. (4.26) this\ncurrent sensitivity is,\nNAB\nI k\nφ = (4.27)\nA convenient way for the manufacturer  to increase the sensitivity is\nto increase the number of turns N.

For this it must be connected\nin parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very\nsmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original\nset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the\ndisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent.  To ensure\nthis, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer.\nThis arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that the\nresistance of the voltmeter is now,\nRG + R ≃ R :  large\nThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value\nwith ease.

This is consistent with the\nfact that no net charge is enclosed by the surface. However,\nin the same figure, for the closed surface ii , there is a net\noutward flux, since it does include a net (positive) charge.\nThe situation is radically different for magnetic fields\nwhich are continuous and form closed loops. Examine the\nGaussian surfaces represented by  i  or  ii  in Fig 5.2(a) or\nFig. 5.2(b). Both cases visually demonstrate that the\nnumber of magnetic field lines leaving the surface is\nbalanced by the number of lines entering it. The net\nmagnetic flux is zero for both the surfaces. This is true\nfor any closed surface.\nFIGURE 5.5\nConsider a small vector area element ∆S of a closed surface S as in\nFig. 5.5. The magnetic flux through ÄS is defined as ∆\nφB = B.∆S, where B\nis the field  at ∆S. We divide S into many small area elements and calculate\nthe individual flux through each.

There are no sources or sinks\nof B; the simplest magnetic element is a dipole or a current loop.

Magnetic field lines can never emanate from a point, as\nshown in figure. Over any closed surface, the net flux of B must\nalways be zero, i.e., pictorially as many field lines should seem to\nenter the surface as the number of lines leaving it. The field lines\nshown, in fact, represent electric field of a long positively charged\nwire. The correct magnetic field lines are circling the straight\nconductor, as described in Chapter 4.\n(b) Wrong. Magnetic field lines (like electric field lines) can never cross\neach other, because otherwise the direction of field at the point of\nintersection is ambiguous. There is further error in the figure.\nMagnetostatic field lines can never form closed loops around empty\nspace. A closed loop of static magnetic field line must enclose a\nregion across which a current is passing. By contrast, electrostatic\nfield lines can never form closed loops, neither in empty space,\nnor when the loop encloses charges.\n(c) Right. Magnetic lines are completely confined within a toroid.\nNothing wrong here in field lines forming closed loops, since each\nloop encloses a region across which a current passes. Note, for\nclarity of figure, only a few field lines within the toroid have been\nshown. Actually, the entire region enclosed by the windings\ncontains magnetic field.\n(d) Wrong. Field lines due to a solenoid at its ends and outside cannot\nbe so completely straight and confined; such a thing violates\nAmpere’s law. The lines should curve out at both ends, and meet\neventually to form closed loops.\n(e) Right. These are field lines outside and inside a bar magnet. Note\ncarefully the direction of field lines inside. Not all field lines emanate\nout of a north pole (or converge into a south pole). Around both\nthe N-pole, and the S-pole, the net flux of the field is zero.\n(f ) Wrong. These field lines cannot possibly represent a magnetic field.\nLook at the upper region.

The difference between Fig. [5.6(e) and ( f)]  should be\ncarefully grasped.\n(g) Wrong. Magnetic field lines between two pole pieces cannot be\nprecisely straight at the ends.

[Analogous to\nGauss’s law of electrostatics,\nB s.Δ =∫ µ0qmS\nwhere qm is the\n(monopole) magnetic charge enclosed by S.]\n(c) No. There is no force or torque on an element due to the field\nproduced by that element itself. But there is a force (or torque)\non an element of the same wire. (For the special case of a straight\nwire, this force is zero.)\n(d) Yes. The average of the charge in the system may be zero. Yet,\nthe mean of the magnetic moments due to various current loops\nmay not be zero.

One would like to classify the magnetic properties of these\nsubstances. In the present section, we define and explain certain terms\nwhich will help us to carry out this exercise.\nWe have seen that a circulating electron in an atom has a magnetic\nmoment. In a bulk material, these moments add up vectorially and they\ncan give a net magnetic moment which is non-zero. We define\nmagnetisation M of a sample to be equal to its net magnetic moment per\nunit volume:\nnet\nV= mM (5.7)\nM is a vector with dimensions L–1 A and is measured in a units of A m–1.\nConsider a long solenoid of n turns per unit length and carrying a\ncurrent I. The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid was shown to\nbe given by\nB0 = µ0 nI (5.8)\nIf the interior of the solenoid is filled with a material with non-zero\nmagnetisation, the field inside the solenoid will be greater than B0. The\nnet B field in the interior of the solenoid may be expressed as\nB = B0 + Bm (5.9)\nPhysics\n146\nEXAMPLE 5.5\nwhere Bm is the field contributed by the material core. It turns out that\nthis additional field Bm is proportional to the magnetisation M of the\nmaterial and is expressed as\nBm = µ0M (5.10)\nwhere µ0 is the same constant (permittivity of vacuum) that appears in\nBiot-Savart’s law.\nIt is convenient to introduce another vector field H, called the magnetic\nintensity, which is defined by\n0\n–µ= BH M (5.11)\nwhere H has the same dimensions as M and is measured in units of A m–1.\nThus, the total magnetic field B is written as\nB = µ0 (H + M) (5.12)\nWe repeat our defining procedure. We have partitioned the contribution\nto the total magnetic field inside the sample into two parts: one, due to\nexternal factors such as the current in the solenoid. This is represented\nby H. The other is due to the specific nature of the magnetic material,\nnamely M. The latter quantity can be influenced by external factors. This\ninfluence is mathematically expressed as\nχ=M H (5.13)\nwhere χ , a dimensionless quantity, is appropriately called the magnetic\nsusceptibility. It is a measure of how a magnetic material responds to an\nexternal field. χ is small and positive for materials, which are called\nparamagnetic. It is small and negative for materials, which are termed\ndiamagnetic. In the latter case M and H are opposite in direction. From\nEqs. (5.12) and (5.13) we obtain,\n0( 1 )µ χ= +B H (5.14)\n= µ0 µr H\n=  µ H (5.15)\nwhere µr= 1 + χ, is a dimensionless quantity called the relative magnetic\npermeability of the substance. It is the analog of the dielectric constant in\nelectrostatics. The magnetic permeability of the substance is µ and it has\nthe same dimensions and units as µ0;\nµ = µ0µr = µ0 (1+χ).\nThe three quantities χ, µr and µ are interrelated and only one of\nthem is independent.

Diamagnetic substances are the ones\nin which resultant magnetic moment in an atom is zero. When magnetic\nfield is applied, those electrons having orbital magnetic moment in the\nsame direction slow down and those in the opposite direction speed up.\nThis happens due to induced current in accordance with Lenz’s law which\nyou will study in Chapter 6.

Thus, scientific understanding is\nnot a necessary condition for engineering applications. Ideally, science\nand engineering go hand-in-hand, one leading and assisting the other in\ntandem.\n2. Magnetic monopoles do not exist. If you slice a magnet in half, you get\ntwo smaller magnets. On the other hand, isolated positive and negative\ncharges exist. There exists a smallest unit of charge, for example, the\nelectronic charge with value | e| = 1.6 ×10 –19 C. All other charges are\nintegral multiples of this smallest unit charge. In other words, charge is\nquantised. We do not know why magnetic monopoles do not exist or why\nelectric charge is quantised.\n3. A consequence of the fact that magnetic monopoles do not exist is that\nthe magnetic field lines are continuous and form closed loops. In contrast,\nthe electrostatic lines of force begin on a positive charge and terminate\non the negative charge (or fade out at infinity).\n4. A miniscule difference in the value of\nχ, the magnetic susceptibility, yields\nradically different behaviour: diamagnetic versus paramagnetic.

When the North-pole of a bar magnet is pushed\ntowards the coil, the pointer in the galvanometer deflects,\nindicating  the presence of electric  current in the coil. The\ndeflection lasts as long as the bar magnet is in motion.\nThe galvanometer does not show any deflection when the\nmagnet is held stationary. When the magnet is pulled\naway from the coil, the galvanometer shows deflection in\nthe opposite direction, which indicates reversal of the\ncurrent’s direction. Moreover, when the South-pole of\nthe bar magnet is moved towards or away from the\ncoil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite\nto that observed with the North-pole for similar\nmovements. Further, the deflection (and hence current)\nis found to be larger when the magnet is pushed\ntowards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead,\nwhen the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C1 is\nmoved towards or away from the magnet, the same\neffects are observed.

Experimental observations\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept.\nThe motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C 1 in\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C2 towards\nor away from coil C1 in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\nflux associated with coil C1.  The change in magnetic flux induces\nemf in coil C1. It was this induced emf which caused electric\ncurr\nent to flow in coil C 1 and through the galvanometer . A\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\ncoil C2 (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\nflux through the neighbouring coil C1 also increases. It is the change in\nmagnetic flux through coil C1 that produces an induced emf in coil C1.\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C2 is constant. Therefore,\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C1 and the current in\ncoil C1 drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C2 and the\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C 1\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C 1*. The common\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\ninduction. The law is stated below.\nFIGURE 6.4 A plane of\nsurface area A placed in a\nuniform magnetic field B.\nFIGURE 6.5 Magnetic field Bi\nat the i th area element. d Ai\nrepresents area vector of the\nith area element.\n* Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents)  when the\nelectromagnet is turned on or off.\nPhysics\n158\nEXAMPLE 6.1\nThe magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal\nto the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the\ncircuit.\nMathematically, the induced emf is given by\nd– d\nB\nt\nΦε = (6.3)\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of e  and hence\nthe direction of current in a closed loop. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in the next section.\nIn the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change\nof flux associated with each turn, is the same. Therefore,\nthe expression for the total induced emf is given by\nd– d\nBN t\nΦε = (6.4)\nThe induced emf can be increased by increasing the\nnumber of turns N of a closed coil.\nFrom Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2), we see that the flux can be\nvaried by changing any one or more of the terms B, A and\nq. In Experiments 6.1 and 6.2 in Section 6.2, the flux is\nchanged by varying B. The flux can also be altered by\nchanging the shape of a coil (that is, by shrinking it or\nstretching it) in a magnetic field, or rotating a coil in a\nmagnetic field such that the angle\nq  between B and A\nchanges.

The statement of the law is:\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.\nThe negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux.\nThis is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet.\nNote that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet. Similarly, if the North-\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\ncorresponding decrease in flux.\nWhat will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\ndirection shown by\nand  indicate the directions of the induced\ncurrents.\nA little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\nand hence can not happen.\nNow consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\nthe bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\ncurrent. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet.\nWhere does the energy spent by the person go?

(6.5)\nby invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor\nPQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod\nmoves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed\nv in the\nmagnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,\nand its direction is towards Q.

Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric\nfield term E alone.

However, we hasten to add that electric fields\nproduced by static electric charges have properties different from those\nproduced by time-varying magnetic fields.

A current I1 is passed through the\nsolenoid S1 and the flux linkage with coil S2 is,\nN2Φ2 = M21 I1 (6.10)\nM21 is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S2 with respect to\nsolenoid S1.\nThe flux due to the current I1 in S1 can be assumed to be confined\nsolely inside S1 since the solenoids are very long.

(6.9) and Eq. (6.10), we get\nM12 = M21= M (say) (6.12)\nWe have demonstrated this equality for long co-axial solenoids.\nHowever, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid\nwas much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then\nwe could still have calculated the flux linkage N1Φ1 because the inner\nsolenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the\nouter solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M12 would be easy. However,\nit would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer\nsolenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across\nthe length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the\ncalculation of M21 would also be extremely difficult in this case.

It is also possible that emf is induced in a\nsingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of\nvarying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called\nself-induction. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is\nproportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as\nBN IΦ ∝\nB LN IΦ = (6.13)\nwhere constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance of the coil. It\nis also called the coefficient of self-induction of the coil. When the current\nis varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced\nin the coil. Using Eq.

The\nmodern ac generator with a typical output\ncapacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine.\nIn this section, we shall describe the basic\nprinciples behind this machine. The Yugoslav\ninventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the\ndevelopment of the machine. As was pointed out\nin Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or\ncurrent in a loop is through a change in the\nloop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.\nAs the coil rotates in a magnetic field B , the\neffective area of the loop (the face perpendicular\nto the field) is A cos\nq, where q is the angle\nbetween A and B. This method of producing a\nflux change is the principle of operation of a\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\n171\nsimple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical ener gy into\nelectrical energy.\nThe basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.13. It consists\nof a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is\nperpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called\narmature) is mechanically rotated in the  uniform magnetic field by some\nexternal means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux through\nit to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the\ncoil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings\nand brushes.\nWhen the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed\nw, the angle q\nbetween the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at any\ninstant t is q  = wt (assuming q = 0° at t = 0). As a result, the effective area\nof the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from\nEq. (6.1), the flux at any time t is\nFB = BA cos q = BA cos wt\nFrom Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns\nis then,\nd d– – (cos )dt d\nBN NBA t t\nΦε ω= =\nThus, the instantaneous value of the emf is\nε ω ω= NBA sin t (6.19)\nwhere NBAw is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when\nsin wt = ±1. If we denote NBAw as e0, then\ne = e0 sin wt (6.20)\nSince the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or\npolarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.14 that the emf\nhas its extremum value when\nq = 90° or q = 270°, as the change of flux is\ngreatest at these points.\nThe direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current\nis called alternating current (ac). Since w = 2pn, Eq (6.20) can be written as\ne = e0sin 2p n t (6.21)\nwhere n is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil.\nNote that Eq. (6.20) and (6.21) give the instantaneous value of the emf\nand e varies between + e0 and – e0 periodically. W e shall lear n how to\ndetermine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current\nin the next chapter.\nIn commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for\nrotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for\nexample, from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators .\nAlternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other\nsources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the\narmature. These ar e called thermal generators . Instead of coal, if a\nnuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators .

These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages\nand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains\nsupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function\nwith time. Such a voltage is called alter nating voltage (ac voltage) and\nthe current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac\ncurrent)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage.\nThis is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power\ncompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current.

The antenna of a radio accepts\nsignals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the\nantenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit\ncan be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio\nstation, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a\ncapacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the\ncircuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received.\nWhen this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of\nthe signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum.\nIt is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a\ncircuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit.

This is done with\na device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction.\nA transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other.\nThey are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in\nFig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the\ncoils called the primary coil has Np turns. The other coil is called the\nsecondary coil; it has Ns turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil\nand the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.\nFIGURE 7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:\n(a) two coils on top of each other , (b) two coils on separate limbs of the cor e.\nWhen an alternating voltage is applied to the  primary, the resulting\ncurrent produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary\nand induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of\nturns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the\nprimary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both\nprimary and secondary windings.

It can be reduced by\nwinding the primary and secondary coils one over the other.\n(ii) Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some\nresistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire\n(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by\nusing thick wire.\n(iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents\nin the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a\nlaminated core.\n(iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by\nthe alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in\nthe core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic\nmaterial which has a low hysteresis loss.\nThe large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over\nlong distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output\nof the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and\nconsequently, the I 2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long\ndistances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage\nis stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations\nand utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes.\n197\nAlternating Current\n4. An ac voltage v = v m sin wt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the\ncapacitor: i = i m sin ( wt + p/2). Here,\n1,m\nm C\nC\nvi X X C ω= =  is called capacitive reactance.\nThe current through the capacitor is p /2 ahead of the applied voltage.\nAs in the case of inductor , the average power supplied to a capacitor\nover one complete cycle is zero.\n5. For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = v m sin  wt, the current is\ngiven by i = i m sin ( wt + f)\nwhere\n( )\n22\nm\nm\nC L\nvi\nR X X\n=\n+ −\nand 1tan C LX X\nRφ − −=\n( )\n22\nC LZ R X X= + −  is called the impedance of the circuit.\nThe average power loss over a complete cycle is given by\nP = V I cos f\nThe ter m cos f is called the power factor.\n6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cos f = 0 and no power is\ndissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,\ncurrent is referred to as a wattless current.\n7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit\ncan be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by\nrotating vectors called phasors . A phasor is a vector which rotates\nabout the origin with angular speed\nw. The magnitude of a phasor\nrepresents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or\ncurrent) r epresented by the phasor .\nThe analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor\ndiagram.\n8.

When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms\nvalue. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is\nnormally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude\nof this voltage is\nV2 2(240) 340mv V= = =\n2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average\npower rating.\n3. The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative.\n4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.\nBut how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be\nderived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac\ncurrents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction\n199\nAlternating Current\nwith the source frequency and the attractive force would average to\nzero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property\nthat is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating\nis such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of\nalternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same\naverage heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce\nunder the same conditions.\n5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one\nshould take care of their phases properly. For example, if VR and VC\nare voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the\ntotal voltage across RC combination is\n2 2\nRC R CV V V= +  and not\nVR + V C since VC is p/2 out of phase of VR.\n6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by\nvectors, the se quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are\nscalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of\nharmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same\nway as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding\nmagnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide\nus with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that\nwe already know as the law of vector addition.\n7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure\ninductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy\nin an ac  circuit is the resistive element.\n8.

Is the converse also true? Does an\nelectric field changing with time give rise to a magnetic field? James Clerk\nMaxwell (1831-1879), argued that this was indeed the case – not only\nan electric current but also a time-varying electric field generates magnetic\nfield. While applying the Ampere’s circuital law to find magnetic field at a\npoint outside a capacitor connected to a time-varying current, Maxwell\nnoticed an inconsistency in the Ampere’s circuital law. He suggested the\nexistence of an additional current, called by him, the displacement\ncurrent to remove this inconsistency.\nMaxwell formulated a set of equations involving electric and magnetic\nfields, and their sources, the charge and current densities. These\nequations are known as Maxwell’s equations. Together with the Lorentz\nforce formula (Chapter 4), they mathematically express all the basic laws\nof electromagnetism.\nThe most important prediction to emerge from Maxwell’s equations\nis the existence of electromagnetic waves, which are (coupled) time-\nvarying electric and magnetic fields that propagate in space. The speed\nof the waves,  according to these equations, turned out to be very close to\nPhysics\n202\nthe speed of light( 3 ×108 m/s), obtained from optical\nmeasurements. This led to the remarkable conclusion\nthat light is an electromagnetic wave. Maxwell’s work\nthus unified the domain of electricity, magnetism and\nlight. Hertz, in 1885, experimentally demonstrated the\nexistence of electromagnetic waves. Its technological use\nby Marconi and others led in due course to the\nrevolution in communication that we are witnessing\ntoday.\nIn this chapter , we first discuss the need for\ndisplacement current and its consequences. Then we\npresent a descriptive account of electromagnetic waves.\nThe broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves,\nstretching from g rays (wavelength ~10 –12 m) to long\nradio waves (wavelength ~106 m) is described.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "8", "chapter_title": "Electromagnetic Waves", "type": "section", "identifier": "8.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 2, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "section_id": "8.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "8.2  DISPLACEMENT CURRENT\nWe have seen in Chapter 4 that an electrical curr ent\nproduces a magnetic field around it. Maxwell showed\nthat for logical consistency, a changing electric field must\nalso produce a magnetic field. This effect is of great\nimportance because it explains the existence of radio\nwaves, gamma rays and visible light, as well as all other\nforms of electromagnetic waves.\nTo see how a changing electric field gives rise to\na magnetic field, let us consider the process of\ncharging of a capacitor and apply Ampere’s circuital\nlaw given by (Chapter 4)\n“B.dl =\nm0 i (t)           (8.1)\nto find magnetic  field at a point outside the capacitor.\nFigure 8.1(a)  shows a parallel plate capacitor C which\nis a part of circuit through which a time-dependent\ncurrent i (t) flows . Let us find the magnetic field at a\npoint such as P, in a region outside the parallel plate\ncapacitor.  For this, we consider a plane circular loop of\nradius r whose plane is perpendicular to the direction\nof the current-carrying wire, and which is centred\nsymmetrically with respect to the wire [Fig. 8.1(a)]. From\nsymmetry, the magnetic field is directed along the\ncircumference of the circular loop and is the same in\nmagnitude at all points on the loop so that if B is the\nmagnitude of the field, the left side of Eq. (8.1) is B (2\np r).\nSo we have\nB (2pr) = m0i (t)    (8 .2)\nJAMES CLERK MAXWELL (1831–1879)\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n(1831 – 1879)  Born in\nEdinburgh, Scotland,\nwas among the greatest\nphysicists of the\nnineteenth century. He\nderived the thermal\nvelocity distribution of\nmolecules in a gas and\nwas among the first to\nobtain reliable\nestimates of molecular\nparameters from\nmeasurable quantities\nlike viscosity, etc.\nMaxwell’s greatest\nacheivement was the\nunification of the laws of\nelectricity and\nmagnetism (discovered\nby Coulomb, Oersted,\nAmpere and Faraday)\ninto a consistent set of\nequations now called\nMaxwell’s equations.\nFrom these he arrived at\nthe most important\nconclusion that light is\nan electromagnetic\nwave. Interestingly,\nMaxwell did not agree\nwith the idea (strongly\nsuggested by the\nFaraday’s laws of\nelectrolysis) that\nelectricity was\nparticulate in nature.\n203\nElectromagnetic\nWaves\nNow, consider a different surface, which has the same boundary. This\nis a pot like surface [Fig. 8.1(b)] which nowhere touches the current, but\nhas its bottom between the capacitor plates; its mouth is the circular\nloop mentioned above. Another such surface is shaped like a tiffin box\n(without the lid) [Fig. 8.1(c)]. On applying Ampere’s circuital law to such\nsurfaces with the same perimeter, we find that the left hand side of\nEq. (8.1) has not changed but the right hand side is zero and not\nm0i,\nsince no current passes through the surface of Fig. 8.1(b) and (c). So we\nhave a contradiction; calculated one way, there is a magnetic field at a\npoint P; calculated another way, the magnetic field at P is zero.\nSince the contradiction arises from our use of Ampere’s circuital law,\nthis law must be missing something. The missing term must be such\nthat one gets the same magnetic field at point P,  no matter what surface\nis used.\nWe can actually guess the missing ter m by looking car efully at\nFig. 8.1(c). Is there anything passing through the surface S between the\nplates of the capacitor? Yes, of course, the electric field! If the plates of the\ncapacitor have an area A, and a total charge Q, the magnitude of the\nelectric field E between the plates is (Q/A)/e0 (see Eq. 2.41). The field is\nperpendicular to the surface S of Fig. 8.1(c). It has the same magnitude\nover the area A of the capacitor plates, and vanishes outside it. So what\nis the electric flux\nFE through the surface S ? Using Gauss’s law, it is\nE\n0 0\n1= = Q QA A AΦ ε ε =E (8.3)\nNow if the charge Q on the capacitor plates changes with time, there is a\ncurrent i = (dQ/dt), so that using Eq. (8.3), we have\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nd\nΦE\nt t\nQ Q\nt= \n\n\n =ε ε0 0\n1\nThis implies that for consistency,\nε0\nd\nd\nΦE\nt\n\n \n\n= i (8.4)\nThis is the missing term in Ampere’s circuital law. If we generalise\nthis law by adding to the total current carried by conductors through\nthe surface, another term which is e0 times the rate of change of electric\nflux through the same surface, the total has the same value of current i\nfor all surfaces. If this is done, there is no contradiction in the value of B\nobtained anywhere using the generalised Ampere’s law. B at the point P\nis non-zero no matter which surface is used for calculating it. B at a\npoint P outside the plates [Fig. 8.1(a)] is the same as at a point M just\ninside, as it should be. The current carried by conductors due to flow of\ncharges is called conduction current. The current, given by Eq. (8.4), is a\nnew term, and is due to changing electric field (or electric displacement,\nan old term still used sometimes). It is, therefore, called displacement\ncurrent or Maxwell’s displacement current. Figure 8.2 shows the electric\nand magnetic fields inside the parallel plate capacitor discussed above.\nThe generalisation made by Maxwell then is the following. The source\nof a magnetic field is not just the conduction electric current due to flowing\nFIGURE 8.1 A\nparallel plate\ncapacitor C, as part of\na circuit through\nwhich a time\ndependent current\ni (t) flows,  (a) a loop of\nradius r, to deter mine\nmagnetic field at a\npoint P on the loop;\n(b) a pot-shaped\nsurface passing\nthrough the interior\nbetween the capacitor\nplates with the loop\nshown in (a) as its\nrim; (c) a tiffin-\nshaped surface with\nthe circular loop as\nits rim and a flat\ncircular bottom S\nbetween the capacitor\nplates. The arrows\nshow uniform electric\nfield between the\ncapacitor plates.\nPhysics\n204\ncharges, but also the time rate of change of electric field. M ore\nprecisely, the total current i is the sum of the conduction current\ndenoted by ic, and the displacement current denoted by id (= ✒0\n(d✂E/dt)). So we have\n0\nd\nd\nE\nc d ci i i i t\nΦε= + = + (8.5)\nIn explicit terms, this means that outside the capacitor plates,\nwe have only conduction current ic = i, and no displacement\ncurrent, i.e., id = 0. On the other hand, inside the capacitor, there is\nno conduction current, i.e., ic = 0, and there is only displacement\ncurrent, so that id = i.\nThe generalised (and correct) Ampere’s circuital law has the same\nform as Eq. (8.1), with one difference: “the total current passing\nthrough any surface of which the closed loop is the perimeter” is\nthe sum of the conduction current and the displacement current.\nThe generalised law is\nB li/inteiralloopd = d\nd\n0µ µ ε0 0i t\nc\nE+∫\nΦ\n(8.6)\nand is known as Ampere-Maxwell law.\nIn all respects, the displacement current has the same physical\neffects as the conduction current. In some cases, for example, steady\nelectric fields in a conducting wire, the displacement current may\nbe zero since the electric field E does not change with time. In other\ncases, for example, the charging capacitor above, both conduction\nand displacement currents may be present in different regions of\nspace. In most of the cases, they both may be present in the same\nregion of space, as there exist no perfectly conducting or perfectly\ninsulating medium. Most interestingly, there may be large regions\nof space where there is no conduction current, but there is only a\ndisplacement current due to time-varying electric fields. In such a\nregion, we expect a magnetic field, though there is no (conduction)\ncurrent source nearby! The prediction of such a displacement current\ncan be verified experimentally. For example, a magnetic field (say at point\nM) between the plates of the capacitor in Fig. 8.2(a) can be measured and\nis seen to be the same as that just outside (at P).\nThe displacement current has (literally) far reaching consequences.\nOne thing we immediately notice is that the laws of electricity and\nmagnetism are now more symmetrical*. Faraday’s law of induction states\nthat there is an induced emf equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux.\nNow, since the emf between two points 1 and 2 is the work done per unit\ncharge in taking it from 1 to 2, the existence of an emf implies the existence\nof an electric field. So, we can rephrase Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\ninduction by saying that a magnetic field, changing with time, gives rise\nto an electric field. Then, the fact that an electric field changing with\ntime gives rise to a magnetic field, is the symmetrical counterpart, and is\nFIGURE 8.2 (a) The\nelectric and magnetic\nfields E and B between\nthe capacitor plates, at\nthe point M. (b) A cross\nsectional view of Fig. (a).\n* They are still not perfectly symmetrical; there are no known sources of magnetic\nfield (magnetic monopoles) analogous to electric charges which are sources of\nelectric field.\n205\nElectromagnetic\nWaves\na consequence of the displacement current being a source of a magnetic\nfield. Thus, time- dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each\nother! Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and Ampere-Maxwell\nlaw give a quantitative expression of this statement, with the current\nbeing the total current, as in Eq. (8.5). One very important consequence\nof this symmetry is the existence of electromagnetic waves, which we\ndiscuss qualitatively in the next section.\nMAXWELL’S EQUATIONS IN VACUUM\n1. “E.dA = Q/✒0 (Gauss’s Law for electricity)\n2. “B.dA = 0 (Gauss’s Law for magnetism)\n3. “E.dl =\n–d\nd\nBΦ\ntl = (Faraday’s Law)\n4. “B.dl == d\nd\n0µ µ ε0 0i t\nc\nE\n+ Φ (Ampere – Maxwell Law)", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "8", "chapter_title": "Electromagnetic Waves", "type": "section", "identifier": "8.2", "title": "DISPLACEMENT CURRENT", "page_start": 2, "page_end": 5, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["8.1", "8.2"], "figure_count": 2, "section_id": "8.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "8.3  ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "8", "chapter_title": "Electromagnetic Waves", "type": "section", "identifier": "8.3", "title": "ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES", "page_start": 5, "page_end": 5, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "8.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "8.3.1  Sources of electromagnetic waves\nHow are electromagnetic waves produced? Neither stationary charges\nnor charges in uniform motion (steady currents) can be sources of\nelectromagnetic waves. The former produces only electrostatic fields, while\nthe latter produces magnetic fields that, however, do not vary with time.\nIt is an important result of Maxwell’s theory that accelerated charges\nradiate electromagnetic waves. The proof of this basic result is beyond\nthe scope of this book, but we can accept it on the basis of rough,\nqualitative reasoning. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency.\n(An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.)   This\nproduces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an\noscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric\nfield, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus\nregenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the\nspace. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the\nfrequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the\npropagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the\naccelerated charge.\nFrom the preceding discussion, it might appear easy to test the\nprediction that light is an electromagnetic wave. We might think that all\nwe needed to do was to set up an ac circuit in which the current oscillate\nat the frequency of visible light, say, yellow light. But, alas, that is not\npossible. The frequency of yellow light is about 6 × 10 14 Hz, while the\nfrequency that we get even with modern electronic circuits is hardly about\n1011 Hz. This is why the experimental demonstration of electromagnetic\nPhysics\n206\nwave had to come in the low frequency region (the radio\nwave region), as in the Hertz’s experiment (1887).\nHertz’s successful experimental test of Maxwell’s\ntheory created a sensation and sparked off other\nimportant works in this field. Two important\nachievements in this connection deserve mention. Seven\nyears after Hertz, Jagdish Chandra Bose, working at\nCalcutta (now Kolkata),  succeeded in producing and\nobserving electromagnetic waves of much shorter\nwavelength (25 mm to 5 mm). His experiment, like that\nof Hertz’s, was confined to the laboratory.\nAt around the same time, Guglielmo Marconi in Italy\nfollowed Hertz’s work and succeeded in transmitting\nelectromagnetic waves over distances of many kilometres.\nMarconi’s experiment marks the beginning of the field of\ncommunication using electromagnetic waves.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "8", "chapter_title": "Electromagnetic Waves", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "8.3.1", "title": "Sources of electromagnetic waves", "page_start": 5, "page_end": 6, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "subsection_id": "8.3.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "8.3.2  Nature of electromagnetic waves\nIt can be shown from Maxwell’s equations that electric\nand magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave are\nperpendicular to each other , and to the dir ection of\npropagation. It appears reasonable, say from our\ndiscussion of the displacement current. Consider\nFig. 8.2. The electric field inside the plates of the capacitor\nis directed perpendicular to the plates. The magnetic\nfield this gives rise to via the displacement current is\nalong the perimeter of a circle parallel to the capacitor\nplates. So B and E are perpendicular in this case. This\nis a general feature.\nIn Fig. 8.3, we show a typical example of a plane\nelectromagnetic wave propagating along the z direction\n(the fields are shown as a function of the z coordinate, at\na given time t). The electric field Ex is along the x-axis,\nand varies sinusoidally with z, at a given time. The\nmagnetic field By is along the y-axis, and again varies\nsinusoidally with z.

They differ from all the other waves we have\nstudied so far, in respect that no material medium  is involved in the\nvibrations of the electric and magnetic fields.\nBut what if a material medium is actually there? We know that light,\nan electromagnetic wave, does propagate through glass, for example. We\nhave seen earlier that the total electric and magnetic fields inside a\nmedium are described in terms of a permittivity\nε and a magnetic\npermeability µ (these describe the factors  by which the total fields differ\nfrom the external fields). These replace ε0 and µ0 in the description to\nelectric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations with the result that in\na material medium of permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ, the\nvelocity of light becomes,\n1v\nµε\n= (8.11)\nThus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of\nthe medium. We shall see in the next chapter that the refractive index of\none medium with respect to the other is equal to the ratio of velocities of\nlight in the two media.\nThe velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space or vacuum is an\nimportant fundamental constant. It has been shown by experiments on\nelectromagnetic waves of different wavelengths that this velocity is the\nsame (independent of wavelength) to within a few metres per second, out\nof a value of 3 ×108 m/s. The constancy of the velocity of em waves in\nvacuum is so strongly supported by experiments and the actual value is\nso well known now that this is used to define a standard of length.\nThe great technological importance of electromagnetic waves stems\nfrom their capability to carry energy from one place to another. The\nradio and TV signals from broadcasting stations carry energy. Light\ncarries energy from the sun to the earth, thus making life possible on\nthe earth.\nPhysics\n208\nEXAMPLE 8.2  EXAMPLE 8.1", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "8", "chapter_title": "Electromagnetic Waves", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "8.3.2", "title": "Nature of electromagnetic waves", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 8, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["8.2", "8.3"], "figure_count": 2, "subsection_id": "8.3.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Example 8.1 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency\n25 MHz travels in free space along the x-direction.

Its presently accepted value\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 × 108 m s–1.  For many purposes, it suffices\nto take c = 3 × 10 8 m s–1. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\nspeed attainable in nature.\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger).\nIn this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\nPhysics\n222\nFIGURE 9.1 The incident ray, reflected ray\nand the normal to the reflecting surface lie\nin the same plane.\nFIGURE 9.2  The Cartesian Sign Convention.\nthem.

A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an\nobliquely incident (0°< i < 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,\nchanges at the interface of the two media. This phenomenon is called\nrefraction of light . Snell experimentally obtained the following laws\nof refraction:\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the\nnormal to the interface at the point of\nincidence, all lie in the same plane.\n(ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence\nto the sine of angle of refraction is constant.\nRemember that the angles of incidence (i ) and\nrefraction (r ) are the angles that the incident\nand  its refracted ray make with the normal,\nrespectively. We have\n21\nsin\nsin\ni nr = (9.10)\nwhere n 21 is a constant, called the refractive\nindex of the second medium with respect to the\nfirst medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known\nSnell’s law of r efraction. We note that n 21 is a\ncharacteristic of the pair of media (and also depends on the wavelength\nof light), but is independent of the angle of incidence.\nFrom Eq. (9.10), if n 21 > 1, r < i, i.e., the refracted ray bends towards\nthe normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or\ndenser, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if n 21 <1, r > i, the\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\n229\nrefracted ray bends away from the normal. This\nis the case when incident ray in a denser\nmedium refracts into a rarer medium.\nNote:  Optical density should not be\nconfused with mass density, which is mass\nper unit volume. It is possible that mass\ndensity of an optically denser medium may\nbe less than that of an optically rarer\nmedium (optical density is the ratio of the\nspeed of light in two media). For example,\nturpentine and water . Mass density of\nturpentine is less than that of water but\nits optical density is higher .\nIf n 21 is the refractive index of medium 2 with\nrespect to medium 1 and n12 the refractive index\nof medium 1 with respect to medium 2, then it\nshould be clear that\n12\n21\n1n n= (9.11)\nIt also follows that if n32 is the refractive index\nof medium 3 with respect to medium 2 then  n 32 =\nn 31 ×  n 12, where  n 31 is the refractive index  of\nmedium 3 with respect to medium 1.\nSome elementary results based on the laws of\nrefraction follow immediately. For a rectangular\nslab, refraction takes place at two interfaces (air-\nglass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9\nthat r2 = i1, i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the\nincident ray—there is no deviation, but it does\nsuffer lateral displacement/shift with respect to the\nincident ray. Another familiar observation is that\nthe bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be\nraised (Fig. 9.10).

The refracted ray is bent\nso much away from the normal that it\ngrazes the surface at the interface between\nthe two media. This is shown by the ray\nAO3 D in Fig. 9.11. If the angle of incidence\nis increased still further (e.g., the ray AO4),\nrefraction is not possible, and the incident\nray is totally reflected. This is called total\ninter nal r eflection . When light gets\nreflected by a surface, normally some\nfraction of it gets transmitted. The\nreflected ray, therefore, is always less\nintense than the incident ray, howsoever\nsmooth the reflecting surface may be. In\ntotal internal reflection, on the other hand,\nno transmission of light takes place.\nThe angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90°,\nsay ÐAO3N, is called the critical angle (ic ) for the given pair of media.   We\nsee from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)] that if the relative refractive index of the\nrefracting medium is less than one then, since the maximum value of sin\nr is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law\ncan be satisfied, that is, i = ic such that\nsin ic  = n 21 (9.12)\nFor values of  i larger than ic, Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible.\nThe refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\n2 will be n12 = 1/sinic.

In subsequent discussions of optical\ninstruments (microscope and telescope) we shall assume the image to be\nat infinity.\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\n243\nA simple microscope has a limited maximum magnification (£ 9) for\nrealistic focal lengths. For much larger magnifications, one uses two lenses,\none compounding the effect of the other. This is known as a compound\nmicroscope. A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown\nin Fig. 9.24. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a\nreal, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for\nthe second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple\nmicroscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlar ged\nand virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal\nplane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation\nat infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly,\nthe final image is inverted with respect to the original object.\nWe now obtain the magnification due to a compound micr oscope.\nThe ray diagram of Fig. 9.24 shows that the (linear) magnification due to\nthe objective, namely h¢/h, equals\nO\no\nh Lm h f\n′= = (9.43)\nwhere we have used the result\ntan β = \n\n\n = ′\n \n\nh\nf\nh\nLo\nHere h¢ is the size of the first image, the object size being h and fo\nbeing the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the\nfocal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the\nsecond focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece\n(focal length fe) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.\nThe world’s largest optical telescopes\nhttp://astro.nineplanets.org/bigeyes.html\nFIGURE 9.24  Ray diagram for the formation of image by a\ncompound microscope.\nPhysics\n244\nAs the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we\nuse the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to\nobtain the (angular) magnification me due to it  [Eq.

Refracting telescopes can be used both for\nterrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider\na telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece\na focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is\nm = 100/1 = 100.\nLet us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1¢ (one minute of\narc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 ×\n1¢\n= 100¢ =1.67°.\nThe main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light\ngathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly\ndepends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects\ncan be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects\ndistinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on\nthe diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is\nto make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective\nin use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory\nin Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore,\ndifficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult\nand expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that\nare free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.\nFor these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather\nthan a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called\nreflecting telescopes. Ther e is no chr omatic aberration in a mirr or.\nMechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs\nmuch less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported\nover its entire back surface, not just over its rim.

The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and\npairs of media at the point of the incidence.\n2. The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\nremoved, is the image still there?  This question puzzles many, because\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\naway. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\nair during a laser show.\n3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\nthe page of a book.\n4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\nwhite light.\n5.

It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface.\nThe corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction)\nbends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the\nsecond medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed\nby Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of\nthe tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very\noften attributed to Newton.\nIn 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the\nwave theory of light – it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in\nthis chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain\nthe phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on\nrefraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light\nwould be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the\nprediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much\nlater confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of\nlight in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the\nwave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850.\nThe wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of\nNewton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuum\nPhysics\n256\nand it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate\nfrom one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed\nhis famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established\nthat light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible\nlight was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the\nwavelength of yellow light is about 0. 6 mm. Because of the smallness\nof the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of\ntypical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately\ntravel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we\nhad discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in\nwhich one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called\ngeometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy\npropagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero.\nAfter the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40\nyears or so, many experiments were carried out involving the\ninterference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only\nbe satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus,\naround the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed\nto be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it\nwas thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how\ncould light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained\nwhen Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light.\nMaxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of\nelectricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what\nis known as the wave equation from which he predicted  the existence\nof electromagnetic waves *. From the wave equation, Maxwell could\ncalculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found\nthat the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed\nof light. From this, he propounded that light must be an\nelectromagnetic wave . Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are\nassociated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric\nfield produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing\nmagnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The\nchanging electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of\nelectromagnetic waves (or light  waves) even in vacuum.\nIn this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the\nHuygens principle  and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In\nSections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference\nwhich is based on the principle of superposition. In Sec tion 10.6 we\nwill discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens-\nFresnel principle. Finally in Sec tion 10.7 we will discuss the\nphenomenon of polari sation which is based on the fact that the light\nwaves are\ntransverse electromagnetic waves .\n* Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it\nwas much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the\nlaboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the Hertzian\nwaves\n257\nWave Optics", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "section", "identifier": "10.1", "title": "INTRODUCTION", "page_start": 1, "page_end": 3, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "section_id": "10.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.2  HUYGENS PRINCIPLE\nWe would first define a wavefr ont: when we dr op a small stone on a\ncalm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every\npoint on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a\nphotograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the\ndisturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are\noscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the\nsource. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a\nwavefront ; thus a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant\nphase. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the\nsource is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels\nin a direction perpendicular to the wavefront.\nIf we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions,\nthen the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in\nthe same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a spherical\nwave as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a\nsmall portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have\nwhat is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)].\nNow, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens\nprinciple allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later\ntime\nt. Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction,\nwhich given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine\nthe shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging\nwave and let F1F2 represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t = 0\n(Fig. 10.2). Now, according to Huygens principle, each point of the\nwavefront is the source of a secondary disturbance and the wavelets\nemanating from these points spread out in all directions with the speed\nof the wave. These wavelets emanating from the wavefront are usually\nreferred to as secondary wavelets and if we draw a common tangent\nto all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the wavefront at a\nlater time.\nFIGURE 10.1 (a) A\ndiverging spherical\nwave emanating from\na point source. The\nwavefronts are\nspherical.\nFIGURE 10.2 F 1F2 represents the spherical wavefront (with O as\ncentre) at t = 0. The envelope of the secondary wavelets\nemanating from F 1F2 produces the forward moving  wavefront G 1G2.\nThe backwave D 1D2 does not exist.\nFIGURE 10.1 (b) At a\nlarge distance from\nthe source, a small\nportion of the\nspherical wave can\nbe approximated by a\nplane wave.\nPhysics\n258\nThus, if we wish to determine the shape of the wavefront at t = t, we\ndraw spheres of radius vt from each point on the spherical wavefront\nwhere v represents the speed of the waves in the medium. If we now draw\na common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the\nwavefront at t = t.  The new wavefront shown as G1G2 in Fig. 10.2 is again\nspherical with point O as the centre.\nThe above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which\nis shown as D1D2 in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the\nsecondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the\nbackward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could\nexplain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is\nnot satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from\nmore rigorous wave theory.\nIn a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the\nshape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium\n(Fig. 10.3).", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "section", "identifier": "10.2", "title": "HUYGENS PRINCIPLE", "page_start": 3, "page_end": 4, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.1", "10.2", "10.3"], "figure_count": 3, "section_id": "10.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.3 REFRACTION AND REFLECTION OF\nPLANE WAVES USING HUYGENS PRINCIPLE", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "section", "identifier": "10.3", "title": "REFRACTION AND REFLECTION OF", "page_start": 4, "page_end": 4, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": false, "section_id": "10.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.3.1  Refraction of a plane wave\nWe will now use Huygens principle to derive the laws of refraction.

These phenomena were\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of\nlight. Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they\nundergo reflection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave\npassing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is\nless in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels\nthrough the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt\nin the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. 10.7(b) we\nconsider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of\nthe incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is\ndelayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre\nand therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point\nF which is known as the focus. In Fig. 10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on\na concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging\nto the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction\nand reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors.\nFrom the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a\npoint on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same\nmeasured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light\nto form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses\na shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken\nis the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens.\nPhysics\n262", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "10.3.3", "title": "Reflection of a plane wave by a plane surface", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 8, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.6", "10.7"], "figure_count": 2, "subsection_id": "10.3.3", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.4  COHERENT AND INCOHERENT\nADDITION OF WAVES\nIn this section we will discuss the\ninterference pattern produced by the\nsuperposition of two waves.

In fact at any point on the perpendicular\nbisector of S 1S2, the intensity will be 4 I0.

On the other hand, if the point P is such that the path\ndifference,\nS1P  ~ S2P = (n+ 1\n2\n) l     (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...) (10.10)\nwe will have destructive interference and the resultant intensity will be\nzero. Now, for any other arbitrary point G (Fig. 10.10) let the phase\ndifference between the two displacements be\nf. Thus, if the displacement\nproduced by S1 is given by\ny1 = a cos wt\nthen, the displacement produced by S2 would be\ny2 = a cos (wt + f)\nand the resultant displacement will be given by\ny = y1 + y2\n= a [cos wt + cos (wt +f)]\n= 2 a cos (f/2) cos (wt + f/2)\nThe amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2 a cos ( f/2) and\ntherefore the intensity at that point will be\nI = 4 I0 cos2 (f/2) (10.11)\nIf f = 0, ± 2 p, ± 4 p,… which corresponds to the condition given by\nEq. (10.9) we will have constructive interference leading to maximum\nintensity. On the other hand, if f = ± p, ± 3p, ± 5p … [which corresponds to\nthe condition given by Eq. (10.10)] we will have destructive interference\nleading to zero intensity.\nNow if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going\nup and down regularly) then the phase difference\nf at any point will not\nchange with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the\npositions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if\nthe two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the\ninterference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference\nchanges very rapidly with time, the positions of maxima and minima will\nalso vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity\ndistribution. When this happens, we will observe an average intensity\nthat will be given by\nI = 2 I0 (10.12)\nat all points.\nRipple Tank experiments on wave interference\nhttp://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/wave-interference\n265\nWave Optics\nWhen the phase difference between the two vibrating sources changes\nrapidly with time, we say that the two sources are incoherent and when\nthis happens the intensities just add up.

If\nwe use two sodium lamps illuminating two pinholes\n(Fig. 10.11) we will not observe any interference fringes.\nThis is because of the fact that the light wave emitted\nfrom an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) undergoes\nabrupt phase changes in times of the order of 10 –10\nseconds. Thus the light waves coming out from two\nindependent sources of light will not have any fixed\nphase relationship and would be incoherent, when this\nhappens, as discussed in the previous section, the\nintensities on the screen will add up.\nThe British physicist Thomas Y oung used an\ningenious technique to “lock” the phases of the waves\nemanating from S 1 and S 2. He made two pinholes S 1\nand S2 (very close to each other) on an opaque screen [Fig. 10.12(a)].\nThese were illuminated by another pinholes that was in turn, lit by a\nbright source. Light waves spread out from S and fall on both S1 and S2.\nS1 and S2 then behave like two coherent sources because light waves\ncoming out from S 1 and S2 are derived from the same original source\nand any abrupt phase change in S will manifest in exactly similar phase\nchanges in the light coming out from S1 and S2. Thus, the two sources S1\nand S2 will be locked in phase; i.e., they will be coherent like the two\nvibrating needle in our water wave example [Fig. 10.8(a)].\nThe spherical waves emanating from S 1 and S 2 will produce\ninterference fringes on the screen GG ¢, as shown in Fig. 10.12(b).

Even before Young,\nearly experimenters – including Newton – had noticed that light spreads\nout from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and\nenter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as\ndiffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all,\nyou are hardly surprised to hear sound\nwaves from someone talking around a corner!\nWhen the double slit in Y oung’s\nexperiment is replaced by a single narrow\nslit (illuminated by a monochromatic\nsource), a broad pattern with a central bright\nregion is seen. On both sides, there are\nalternate dark and bright regions, the\nintensity becoming weaker away from the\ncentre (Fig. 10.15). To understand this, go\nto Fig. 10.14, which shows a parallel beam\nof light falling normally on a single slit LN of\nwidth a. The diffracted light goes on to meet\na screen. The midpoint of the slit is M.\nA straight line through M perpendicular\nto the slit plane meets the scr\neen at C. W e want the\nintensity at any point P on the screen. As before, straight\nlines joining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be\ntreated as parallel, making an angle\nq with the\nnormal MC.\nThe basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller\nparts, and add their contributions at P with the proper\nphase differences. We are treating different parts of the\nwavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because the\nincoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these\nsources are in phase.\nIt is observed that the intensity has a central\nmaximum at\nq = 0 and other secondary maxima at q l\n(n+1/2) l/a, which go on becoming weaker and weaker\nwith increasing n. The minima (zero intensity) are at q l\nnl/a, n = ±1, ±2, ±3, ....\nThe photograph and intensity pattern corresponding\nto it is shown in Fig. 10.15.\nThere has been prolonged discussion about\ndifference between intereference and diffraction among\nFIGURE 10.14  The geometry of path\ndifferences for diffraction by a single slit.\nFIGURE 10.15  Intensity\ndistribution and photograph of\nfringes due to diffraction\nat single slit.\nPhysics\n268\nFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE FIGUREFIGURE  10.16 10.16 10.16  10.16 10.16\nHolding two blades to\nform a single slit.

It is just a question\nof usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference\nbetween them\n. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to\nsay that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering\nsources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there\nis a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is\nmore often used.\nIn the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the\nscreen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit\nor hole, and the double-slit interference pattern.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "10.6.1", "title": "The single slit", "page_start": 13, "page_end": 14, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.14", "10.15"], "figure_count": 2, "subsection_id": "10.6.1", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern\nIt is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself.\nThe equipment needed can be found in most homes –– two razor blades\nand one clear glass electric bulb preferably with a straight filament. One\nhas to hold the two blades so that the edges are parallel and have a\nnarrow slit in between. This is easily done with the thumb and forefingers\n(Fig. 10.16).\nKeep the slit parallel to the filament, right in front of the eye. Use\nspectacles if you normally do. With slight adjustment of the width of\nthe slit and the parallelism of the edges, the pattern should be seen\nwith its bright and dark bands. Since the position of all the bands\n(except the central one) depends on wavelength, they will show some\ncolours. Using a filter for r ed or blue will make the fringes clear er.\nWith both filters available, the wider fringes for red compared to blue\ncan be seen.\nIn this experiment, the filament plays the role of the first slit S in\nFig. 10.15. The lens of the eye focuses the pattern on the screen (the\nretina of the eye).\nWith some effort, one can cut a double slit in an aluminium foil with\na blade. The bulb filament can be viewed as befor e to repeat Young’s\nexperiment. In daytime, there is another suitable bright source subtending\na small angle at the eye. This is the reflection of the Sun in any shiny\nconvex surface (e.g., a cycle bell). Do not try direct sunlight – it can damage\nthe eye and will not give fringes anyway as the Sun subtends an angle\nof (1/2)°.\nIn interference and diffraction, light energy is redistributed. If it\nreduces in one region, producing a dark fringe, it increases in another\nregion, producing a bright fringe. There is no gain or loss of energy,\nwhich is consistent with the principle of conservation of energy.\n* **\n** Richard Feynman was one of the recipients of the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics\nfor his fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics.\n269\nWave Optics", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "subsection", "identifier": "10.6.2", "title": "Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern10.6.2  Seeing the single slit diffraction pattern", "page_start": 14, "page_end": 15, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.15", "10.16"], "figure_count": 2, "subsection_id": "10.6.2", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "10.7  POLARISATION\nConsider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of\nwhich is assumed to be fixed. If we move the end of the string up and\ndown in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating  in the\n+x direction (Fig. 10.17). Such a wave could be described by the following\nequation\nFIGURE 10.17  (a) The curves represent the displacement of a string at\nt = 0 and at t = Dt, respectively when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\nin the + x-direction. (b) The curve represents the time variation\nof the displacement at x = 0 when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\nin the + x-direction. At  x = Dx, the time variation of the\ndisplacement will be slightly displaced to the right.\ny (x,t) = a sin (kx – wt) (10.15)\nwhere a and w (= 2pn) represent the amplitude and the angular frequency\nof the wave, respectively; further,\n2\nkλ π= (10.16)\nrepresents the wavelength associated with the wave. We had discussed\npropagation of such waves in Chapter 14 of Class XI textbook. Since the\ndisplacement (which is along the y direction) is at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a\ntransverse wave. Also, since the displacement is in the y direction, it is\noften referred to as a y-polarised wave. Since each point on the string\nmoves on a straight line, the wave is also referred to as a linearly polarised\nPhysics\n270\nwave. Further, the string always remains confined to the x-y plane and\ntherefore it is also referred to as a plane polarised wave.\nIn a similar manner we can consider the vibration of the string in the\nx-z plane generating a z-polarised wave whose displacement will be given\nby\nz (x,t) = a sin (kx – wt) (10.17)\nIt should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described\nby Eqs. (10.15) and (10.17)] are all transverse waves; i.e., the\ndisplacement of each point of the string is always at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave. Finally, if the plane of vibration of\nthe string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we\nhave what is known as an unpolarised wave. Thus, for an unpolarised\nwave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it\nwill always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation.\nLight waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated\nwith a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of\npropagation of the wave. This can be easily demonstrated using a simple\npolaroid. You must have seen thin plastic like sheets, which are called\npolaroids. A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a\nparticular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating\nlight wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed.\nThus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then\nthe light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating\nalong a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules; this direction\nis known as the pass-axis of the polaroid.\nThus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes\nthrough a polaroid sheet P1, it is observed that its intensity is reduced by\nhalf. Rotating P1 has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted\nintensity remains constant. Now, let an identical piece of polaroid P2 be\nplaced before P1. As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in\nintensity on passing through P2 alone. But now rotating P1 has a dramatic\neffect on the light coming from P2. In one position, the intensity transmitted\nby P2 followed by P1 is nearly zero. When turned by 90° from this position,\nP1 transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from P2 (Fig. 10.18).\nThe experiment at figure 10.18 can be easily understood by assuming\nthat light passing through the polaroid P2 gets polarised along  the pass-\naxis of  P2. If the pass-axis of  P2 makes an angle\nq with the pass-axis of\nP1, then  when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid P2, the\ncomponent  E cos q  (along the pass-axis of P2) will pass through P2.\nThus, as we rotate the polaroid P1 (or P2), the intensity will vary as:\nI = I0 cos2q (10.18)\nwhere I0 is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through\nP1. This is known as Malus’ law. The above discussion shows that the\n271\nWave Optics\nFIGURE 10.18 (a) Passage of light through two polaroids P2 and P1. The\ntransmitted fraction falls from 1 to 0 as the angle between them varies\nfrom  0° to 90°. Notice that the light seen through a single polaroid\nP1 does not vary with angle.

The transmitted\npolarisation is the component parallel to the polaroid axis.\nThe double arr ows show the oscillations of the electric vector .\nintensity coming out of a single polaroid is half of the incident intensity.\nBy putting a second polaroid, the intensity can be further controlled\nfrom 50% to zero of the incident intensity by adjusting the angle between\nthe pass-axes of two polaroids.\nPolaroids can be used to control the intensity, in sunglasses,\nwindowpanes, etc. Polaroids are also used in photographic cameras and\n3D movie cameras.\nEXAMPLE 10.2", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "10", "chapter_title": "Wave Optics", "type": "section", "identifier": "10.7", "title": "POLARISATION", "page_start": 15, "page_end": 17, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["10.17", "10.18"], "figure_count": 2, "section_id": "10.7", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Example 10.2 Discuss the intensity of transmitted light when a\npolaroid sheet is rotated between two crossed polaroids?\nSolution Let I0 be the intensity of polarised light after passing through\nthe first polariser P1.

Consequently, the electron can\ncome out of the metal surface only if it has got sufficient energy to overcome\nthe attractive pull. A certain minimum amount of energy is required to be\ngiven  to an electron to pull it out from the surface of the metal. This\nminimum energy required by an electron to escape from the metal surface\nis called the work function of the metal. It is generally denoted by\nf0 and\nmeasured in eV (electron volt).

As\nsoon as the ultraviolet radiations were stopped, the current flow also\nstopped. These observations indicate that when ultraviolet radiations fall\non the emitter plate C, electrons are ejected from it which are attracted\ntowards the positive, collector plate A by the electric field. The electrons\nflow through the evacuated glass tube, resulting in the current flow. Thus,\nlight falling on the surface of the emitter causes current in the external\ncircuit.

The phenomena of interference, diffraction and polarisation were\nexplained in a natural and satisfactory way by the wave picture of light.\nAccording to this picture, light is an electromagnetic wave consisting  of\nelectric and magnetic fields with continuous distribution of energy over\nthe region of space over which the wave is extended. Let us now see if this\n281\nDual Nature of Radiation\nand Matter\nwave picture of light can explain the observations on photoelectric\nemission given in the previous section.\nAccording to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface\nof the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant\nenergy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are\nthe amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater\nthe intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron.\nIn this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the\nsurface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no\nmatter what the frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of\nradiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to\nthe electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape\nfrom the metal surface . A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist.\nThese expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (i),\n(ii) and (iii) given at the end of\nsub-section 11.4.3.\nFurther, we should note that in the wave picture, the absorption of\nenergy by electron takes place continuously over the entire\nwavefront of the radiation.

In this picture,\nphotoelectric emission does not take place by continuous absorption of\nenergy from radiation. Radiation energy is built up of discrete units– the\nso called quanta of energy of radiation. Each quantum of radiant energy\nhas energy hn, where h is Planck’s constant and n the frequency of light.\nIn photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (hn ) of\nradiation. If this quantum of energy absorbed exceeds the minimum\nenergy needed for the electron to escape from the metal surface (work\nfunction f0), the electron is emitted with maximum kinetic energy\nKmax = hn – f0 (11.2)\nMore tightly bound electrons will emerge with kinetic energies less\nthan the maximum value. Note that the intensity of light of a given\nfrequency is determined by the number of photons incident per second.\nIncreasing the intensity will increase the number of emitted electrons per\nsecond. However , the maximum kinetic ener gy of the emitted\nphotoelectrons is determined by the energy of each photon.\nEquation (11.2) is known as Einstein’s photoelectric equation. W e\nnow see how this equation accounts in a simple and elegant manner all\nthe observations on photoelectric effect given at the end of  sub-section\n11.4.3.\nPhysics\n282\n· According to Eq. (11.2), Kmax depends linearly on n,\nand is independent of intensity of radiation, in\nagreement with observation. This has happened\nbecause in Einstein’s picture, photoelectric effect arises\nfrom the absorption of a single quantum of radiation\nby a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is\nproportional to the number of energy quanta per unit\narea per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process.\n· Since Kmax must be non-negative, Eq. (11.2 ) implies\nthat photoelectric emission is possible only if\nh n > f0\nor n > n0 , where\nn0 =\n0\nh\nφ\n(11.3)\nEquation (11.3) shows that the greater the work\nfunction\nf0, the higher the minimum or threshold\nfrequency n 0 needed to emit photoelectrons. Thus,\nthere exists a threshold frequency n0 (= f0/h) for the\nmetal surface, below which no photoelectric  emission\nis possible, no matter how intense the incident\nradiation may be or how long it falls on the surface.\n· In this picture, intensity of radiation as noted above,\nis proportional to the number of energy quanta per\nunit area per unit time. The greater the number of\nenergy quanta available, the greater is the number of\nelectrons absorbing the energy quanta  and greater,\ntherefore, is the number of electrons coming out of\nthe metal (for\nn > n0). This explains why, for n > n0,\nphotoelectric current is proportional to intensity.\n· In Einstein’s picture, the basic elementary process\ninvolved in photoelectric effect is the absorption of a\nlight quantum by an electron. This process is\ninstantaneous. Thus, whatever may be the intensity\ni.e., the number of quanta of radiation per unit area\nper unit time, photoelectric emission is instantaneous.\nLow intensity does not mean delay in emission, since\nthe basic elementary process is the same. Intensity\nonly determines how many electrons are able to\nparticipate in the elementary process (absorption of a\nlight quantum by a single electron) and, therefore, the\nphotoelectric current.\nUsing Eq. (11.1), the photoelectric equation, Eq. (11.2),\ncan be written as\ne V0 = h\nn  – f 0;  for 0ν ν≥\nor  V0 = 0h\ne e\nφν  −    (11.4)\nThis is an important result. It predicts that the V0\nversus n  curve is a straight line with slope = ( h/e),\nALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955)\nAlbert Einstein (1879 –\n1955) Einstein, one of the\ngreatest physicists of all\ntime, was born in Ulm,\nGermany. In 1905, he\npublished three path-\nbreaking papers.  In the\nfirst paper , he intr oduced\nthe notion of light quanta\n(now called photons) and\nused it to explain the\nfeatures of photoelectric\neffect.  In the second paper,\nhe developed a theory of\nBrownian motion,\nconfirmed experimentally a\nfew years later and provided\na convincing evidence of\nthe atomic picture of matter.\nThe third paper gave birth\nto the special theory of\nrelativity. In 1916, he\npublished the general\ntheory of relativity. Some of\nEinstein’s most significant\nlater contributions are: the\nnotion of stimulated\nemission introduced in an\nalternative derivation of\nPlanck’s blackbody\nradiation law, static model\nof the universe which\nstarted modern cosmology,\nquantum statistics of a gas\nof massive bosons, and a\ncritical analysis of the\nfoundations of quantum\nmechanics. In 1921, he was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in\nphysics for his contribution\nto theoretical physics and\nthe photoelectric effect.\n283\nDual Nature of Radiation\nand Matter\nindependent of the nature of the material. During 1906-1916, Millikan\nperformed a series of experiments on photoelectric effect, aimed at disproving\nEinstein’s photoelectric equation. He measured the slope of the straight\nline obtained for sodium, similar to that shown in Fig. 11.5. Using the\nknown value of e, he determined the value of Planck’s constant h. This\nvalue was close to the value of Planck’s contant (= 6.626 × 10 –34J s)\ndetermined in an entirely different context. In this way, in 1916, Millikan\nproved the validity of Einstein’s photoelectric equation, instead of\ndisproving it.\nThe successful explanation of photoelectric effect using the hypothesis\nof light quanta and the experimental determination of values of h and\nφ0,\nin agreement with values obtained from other experiments, led to the\nacceptance of Einstein’s picture of photoelectric effect.

The wave nature of light shows up in the phenomena\nof interference, diffraction and polarisation. On the other hand, in\n285\nDual Nature of Radiation\nand Matter\nphotoelectric effect and Compton effect which involve\nenergy and momentum transfer, radiation behaves as if it\nis made up of a bunch of particles – the photons. Whether\na particle or wave description is best suited for\nunderstanding an experiment depends on the nature of\nthe experiment. For example, in the familiar  phenomenon\nof seeing an object by our eye, both descriptions are\nimportant. The gathering and focussing mechanism of\nlight by the eye-lens is well described in the wave picture.\nBut its absorption by the rods and cones (of the retina)\nrequires the photon picture of light.\nA natural question arises: If radiation has a dual (wave-\nparticle) nature, might not the particles of nature (the\nelectrons, protons, etc.) also exhibit wave-like character?\nIn 1924, the French physicist Louis Victor de Broglie\n(pronounced as de Broy) (1892-1987) put forward the\nbold hypothesis that moving particles of matter should\ndisplay wave-like properties under suitable conditions.\nHe reasoned that nature was symmetrical and that the\ntwo basic physical entities – matter and energy, must have\nsymmetrical character. If radiation shows dual aspects,\nso should matter . De Br oglie proposed that the wave\nlength\nl  associated with a particle of momentum p  is\ngiven as\nl  = h h\np m v= (11.5)\nwhere m  is the mass of the particle and v its speed.\nEquation (11.5) is known as the\nde Broglie relation and\nthe wavelength l of the matter wave is called de Broglie wavelength. The\ndual aspect of matter is evident in the de Broglie relation. On the left hand\nside of Eq. (11.5), l  is the attribute of a wave while on the right hand side\nthe momentum p is a typical attribute of a particle. Planck’s constant  h\nrelates the two attributes.\nEquation (11.5) for a material particle is basically a hypothesis whose\nvalidity can be tested only by experiment. However, it is interesting to see\nthat it is satisfied also by a photon. For a photon, as we have seen,\np = h\nn /c (11.6)\nTherefore,\nh c\np λν= = (11.7)\nThat is, the de Broglie wavelength of a photon given by Eq. (11.5) equals\nthe wavelength of electromagnetic radiation of which the photon is a\nquantum of energy and momentum.\nClearly, from Eq.

The minimum energy needed by an electron to come out from a  metal\nsurface is called the work function of the metal. Energy (greater than\nthe work function (\nfo) required for electron emission from the metal\nsurface can be supplied by suitably heating or applying strong electric\nfield or irradiating it by light of suitable frequency.\n2. Photoelectric effect is the phenomenon of emission of electrons by metals\nwhen illuminated by light of suitable frequency. Certain metals respond\nto ultraviolet light while others are sensitive even to the visible light.\nPhotoelectric effect involves conversion of light energy into electrical\nenergy. It follows the law of conservation of energy. The photoelectric\nemission is an instantaneous process and possesses certain special\nfeatures.\n287\nDual Nature of Radiation\nand Matter\n3. Photoelectric current depends on (i) the intensity of incident light, (ii)\nthe potential difference applied between the two electrodes, and (iii)\nthe nature of the emitter material.\n4. The stopping potential ( Vo) depends on (i) the frequency of incident\nlight, and (ii) the nature of the emitter material. For a given frequency\nof incident light, it is independent of its intensity. The stopping potential\nis directly related to the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted:\ne V0 = (1/2) m v2\nmax = Kmax.\n5. Below a certain frequency (threshold frequency)\nn 0, characteristic of\nthe metal, no photoelectric emission takes place, no matter how large\nthe intensity may be.\n6. The classical wave theory could not explain the main features of\nphotoelectric effect. Its picture of continuous absorption of energy\nfrom radiation could not explain the independence of Kmax on\nintensity, the existence of\nno and the instantaneous nature of the\nprocess. Einstein explained these features on the basis of photon\npicture of light. According to this, light is composed of discrete\npackets of energy called quanta or photons. Each photon carries an\nenergy E (= h\nn) and momentum p (= h/l), which depend on the\nfrequency ( n ) of incident light and not on its intensity. Photoelectric\nemission from the metal surface occurs due to absorption of a photon\nby an electron.\n7. Einstein’s photoelectric equation is in accordance with the energy\nconservation law as applied to the photon absorption by an electron in\nthe metal. The maximum kinetic energy (1/2) m v2\nmax is equal to\nthe photon energy ( h\nn ) minus the work function f0 (= hn0) of the\ntarget metal:\n1\n2 m v2\nmax = V0 e = hn – f0 = h (n – n0)\nThis photoelectric equation explains all the features of the photoelectric\neffect. Millikan’s first precise measurements confirmed the Einstein’s\nphotoelectric equation and obtained an accurate value of Planck’s\nconstant h. This led to the acceptance of particle or photon description\n(nature) of electromagnetic radiation, introduced by Einstein.\n8. Radiation has dual nature: wave and particle. The nature of experiment\ndetermines whether a wave or particle description is best suited for\nunderstanding the experimental result. Reasoning that radiation and\nmatter should be symmetrical in nature, Louis Victor de Broglie\nattributed a wave-like character to matter (material particles). The waves\nassociated with the moving material particles are called matter waves\nor de Broglie waves.\n9. The de Broglie wavelength (\nl) associated with a moving particle is\nrelated to its momentum p as:  l = h/p. The dualism of matter is\ninherent in the de Broglie relation which contains a wave concept\n(l) and a particle concept ( p). The de Broglie wavelength is\nindependent of the charge and nature of the material  particle. It is\nsignificantly measurable (of the order of the atomic-planes spacing\nin crystals) only in case of sub-atomic particles like electrons,\nprotons, etc. (due to smallness of their masses and hence, momenta).\nHowever, it is indeed very small, quite beyond measur ement, in case\nof macroscopic objects, commonly  encountered in everyday life.\nPhysics\n288", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "11", "chapter_title": "Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter", "type": "summary", "identifier": "summary", "title": "SUMMARY", "page_start": 13, "page_end": 15, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true}}, {"content": "POINTS TO PONDER\n1.

This distribution is different from the usual Maxwell’s\ndistribution that you have learnt in the study of kinetic theory of gases.\nYou will lear n about it in later courses, but the dif ference has to do\nwith the fact that electrons obey Pauli’s exclusion principle.\n3.

But what\nis the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom?\nIn other words, what is the structure of an atom?\nThe first model of atom was proposed by J. J.

The spectrum\nappears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the\naverage spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the\nradiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms\nrather than because of interactions between atoms or\nmolecules.\nIn the early nineteenth century it was also established\nthat each element is associated with a characteristic\nspectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives\na set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines.\nThis fact suggested an intimate relationship between the\ninternal structure of an atom and the spectrum of\nradiation emitted by it. In 1885, Johann Jakob Balmer\n(1825 – 1898) obtained a simple empirical formula which\ngave the wavelengths of a group of lines emitted by atomic\nhydrogen. Since hydrogen is simplest of the elements\nknown, we shall consider its spectrum in detail in this\nchapter.\nErnst Rutherford (1871–1937), a former research\nstudent of J. J. Thomson, was engaged in experiments on\nα-particles emitted by some radioactive elements. In 1906,\nhe proposed a classic experiment of scattering of these\nα-particles by atoms to investigate the atomic structure.\nThis experiment was later performed around 1911 by Hans\nGeiger (1882–1945) and Ernst Marsden (1889–1970, who\nwas 20 year -old student and had not yet ear ned his\nbachelor’s degree). The details are discussed in Section\n12.2. The explanation of the results led to the birth of\nRutherford’s planetary model of atom (also called the\nnuclear model of the atom). According to this the entire\npositive charge and most of the mass of the atom is\nconcentrated in a small volume called the nucleus with electrons revolving\naround the nucleus just as planets revolve around the sun.\nRutherford’s nuclear model was a major step towards how we see\nthe atom today. However, it could not explain why atoms emit light of\nonly discrete wavelengths. How could an atom as simple as hydrogen,\nconsisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex\nspectrum of specific wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the\nelectron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves\nround the sun. However , we shall see that ther e ar e some serious\ndifficulties in accepting such a model.\n12.212.212.212.212.2 A\nAA AALPHALPHALPHA LPHALPHA- -- --P PP PPAR ARAR ARARTICLE TICLETICLE TICLETICLE S  S S  S S CA CACA CACATTERING TTERINGTTERING TTERINGTTERING     AND ANDAND ANDAND\nR\nRR RRUTHERFORDUTHERFORDUTHERFORDUTHERFORDUTHERFORD’ ’’ ’’S SS SS N  N N N N UCLEAR UCLEARUCLEAR UCLEARUCLEAR     M MMMMODEL\nODELODEL ODELODEL     OF OFOF OFOF     A AA AATOM TOMTOM TOMTOM\nAt the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H.

In one of their experiments, as shown in\nErnst Rutherford (1871 –Ernst Rutherford (1871 –Ernst Rutherford (1871 –Ernst Rutherford (1871 –Ernst Rutherford (1871 –\n1937) 1937) 1937) 1937) 1937)\nNew Zealand born,\nBritish physicist who did\npioneering work on\nradioactive radiation. He\ndiscovered alpha-rays and\nbeta-rays. Along with\nFederick Soddy, he created\nthe modern theory of\nradioactivity. He studied\nthe ‘emanation’ of thorium\nand discovered a new noble\ngas, an isotope of radon,\nnow known as thoron. By\nscattering alpha-rays from\nthe metal foils, he\ndiscovered the atomic\nnucleus and proposed the\nplanetary model of the\natom. He also estimated the\napproximate size of the\nnucleus.\nERNST RUTHERFORD (1871 – 1937)\nPhysics\n292\nFig. 12.1, they directed a beam of\n5.5 MeV a-particles emitted from a\n214\n83Bi  radioactive source at a thin metal\nfoil made of gold. Figure 12.2 shows a\nschematic diagram of this experiment.\nAlpha-particles emitted by a\n214\n83Bi\nradioactive source were collimated into\na narrow beam by their passage\nthrough lead bricks. The beam was\nallowed to fall on a thin foil of gold of\nthickness 2.1 × 10–7 m. The scattered\nalpha-particles were observed through\na rotatable detector consisting of zinc\nsulphide screen and a microscope. The\nscattered alpha-particles on striking\nthe screen produced brief light flashes\nor scintillations. These flashes may be\nviewed through a microscope and the\ndistribution of the number of scattered\nparticles may be studied as a function\nof angle of scattering.\nFIGURE 12.2 Schematic arrangement of the Geiger -Marsden experiment.\nA typical graph of the total number of a-particles scattered at different\nangles, in a given interval of time, is shown in Fig. 12.3. The dots in this\nfigure represent the data points and the solid curve is the theoretical\nprediction based on the assumption that the target atom has a small,\ndense, positively charged nucleus. Many of the a-particles pass through\nthe foil. It means that they do not suffer any collisions. Only about 0.14%\nof the incident a-particles scatter by more than 1°; and about 1 in 8000\ndeflect by more than 90°. Rutherford argued that, to deflect the a-particle\nbackwards, it must experience a large repulsive force. This force could\nFIGURE 12.1 Geiger -Marsden scattering experiment.\nThe entire apparatus is placed in a vacuum chamber\n(not shown in this figure).\n293\nAtoms\nbe provided if the greater part of the\nmass of the atom and its positive charge\nwere concentrated tightly at its centre.\nThen the incoming α-particle could get\nvery close to the positive charge without\npenetrating it, and such a close\nencounter would result in a large\ndeflection. This agreement supported\nthe hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This\nis why Rutherford is credited with the\ndiscovery of the nucleus.\nIn Rutherford’s nuclear model of\nthe atom, the entire positive charge and\nmost of the mass of the atom are\nconcentrated in the nucleus with the\nelectrons some distance away. The\nelectrons would be moving in orbits\nabout the nucleus just as the planets\ndo around the sun. Rutherford’s\nexperiments suggested the size of\nthe nucleus to be about 10 –15 m to\n10–14 m. From kinetic theory, the size\nof an atom was known to be 10 –10 m,\nabout 10,000 to 100,000 times larger\nthan the size of the nucleus. Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a\ndistance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of\nthe nucleus itself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom\nbeing largely empty space, it is easy to see why most α-particles go right\nthrough a thin metal foil. However , when α-particle happens to come\nnear a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large\nangle. The atomic electrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the\nα-particles.\nThe scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing\nRutherford’s nuclear model of the atom. As the gold foil is very thin, it\ncan be assumed that α-particles will suffer not more than one scattering\nduring their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory\nof an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-\nparticles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e,\nof positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of\nthe gold nucleus is Ze, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for\ngold Z = 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an\nα-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary\nthroughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the\ntrajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton’s\nsecond law of motion and the Coulomb’s law for electrostatic\nforce of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively\ncharged nucleus.\nFIGUREFIGUREFIGUREFIGUREFIGURE 12.3\n12.3 12.3  12.3 12.3  Experimental data points (shown by\ndots) on scattering of α-particles by a thin foil at\ndifferent angles obtained by Geiger and Marsden\nusing the setup shown in Figs. 12.1 and\n12.2.

Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several\nmonths in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford\nnuclear model. Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr , in\n1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in\nexplaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes\nat the atomic scale. It became clear that a fairly radical departure from\nthe established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism\nwould be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation\nof atomic structure to atomic spectra. Bohr combined classical and early\nquantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates.\nThese are :\n(i) Bohr’s first postulate was that an electron in an atom could revolve\nin certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy ,\ncontrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory. According to\nthis postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it\n299\nAtoms\ncan exist, and each possible state has definite total energy. These are\ncalled the stationary states of the atom.\n(ii) Bohr’s second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate\nstates that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those\norbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of\nh/2π where h is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6 × 10–34 J s). Thus the\nangular momentum (L) of the orbiting electron is quantised. That is\nL = nh/2π (12.5)\n(iii) Bohr’s third postulate incorporated into atomic theory the early\nquantum concepts that had been developed by Planck and Einstein.\nIt states that an electron might make a transition from one of its\nspecified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it\ndoes so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy\ndifference between the initial and final states . The frequency of the\nemitted photon is then given by\nh\nν  =   Ei – Ef (12.6)\nwhere Ei and Ef are the energies of the initial and final states and Ei > Ef.\nFor a hydrogen atom, Eq. (12.4) gives the expression to determine\nthe energies of different energy states. But then this equation requires\nthe radius r of the electron orbit.

From these excited states the electron can then fall back\nto a state of lower energy, emitting a photon in the process.\nThus, as the excitation of hydrogen atom increases (that is\nas n increases) the value of minimum energy required to\nfree the electron from the excited atom decreases.\nThe energy level diagram* for the stationary states of a\nhydrogen atom, computed from Eq. (12.10), is given in\nFig. 12.7. The principal quantum number n labels the stationary\nstates in the ascending order of energy.

Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal\namount of positive and negative charges.\n2. In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges\nwith electrons embedded in it.\n3. In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive\ncharge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand\nthe size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it.\n4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the\nstructure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the\naccelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into\nthe nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot\nexplain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements.\n5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic\nspectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines\ntermed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the\natomic structure.\n6. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability\nof atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron)\natoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of\nquantum mechanics:\n(a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits\n(called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy.\n(b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum\nis some integral multiple of h/2p. (Bohr’s quantisation condition.)\nThat is L = nh /2p, where n is an integer called the principal\nquantum number.\n(c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition\nfrom one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower\nenergy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal\nto the energy difference between the initial and final states. The\nfrequency (\nn) of the emitted photon is then given by\nhn  = Ei – E f\nAn atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits,\nin which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher\nvalue of n.\nEi + h\nn  =  Ef\n7.

Both the Thomson’s as well as the Rutherford’s models constitute an\nunstable system. Thomson’s model is unstable electrostatically, while\nRutherford’s model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation\nof orbiting electrons.\n2. What made Bohr quantise angular momentum (second postulate) and\nnot some other quantity? Note, h has dimensions of angular\nmomentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very\nrelevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural!\n3. The orbital picture in Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was\ninconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern\nquantum mechanics in which Bohr’s orbits are regions where the\nelectron may be found with large probability.\n4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet\ngravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational\nforce of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so\nmuch greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron\nelectric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron-\nnucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the\nsame order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr’s model\nwith its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms.\n5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific\norbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr’s model include only\none quantum number n. The new theory called quantum mechanics\nsupports Bohr’s postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more\ngenerally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just\none quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four\nquantum numbers ( n, l, m, and s), but for a pure Coulomb potential\n(as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on n.\n6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the frequency\nof revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to the frequency\nof spectral line. The later is the difference between two orbital energies\ndivided by h. For transitions between large quantum numbers ( n to n\n– 1, n very large), however, the two coincide as expected.\n7.

There are, however, many striking exceptions to this rule. For\nexample, the atomic mass of chlorine atom is 35.46 u.\nAccurate measurement of atomic masses is carried out with a mass\nspectrometer, The measurement of atomic masses reveals the existence\nof different types of atoms of the same element, which exhibit the same\nchemical properties, but differ in mass. Such atomic species of the same\nelement differing in mass are called isotopes. (In Greek, isotope means\nthe same place, i.e. they occur in the same place in the periodic table of\nelements.) It was found that practically every element consists of a mixture\nof several isotopes.  The relative abundance of different isotopes differs\nfrom element to element. Chlorine, for example, has two isotopes having\nmasses 34.98 u and 36.98 u, which are nearly integral multiples of the\nmass of a hydrogen atom.  The relative abundances of these isotopes are\n75.4 and 24.6 per cent, respectively.  Thus, the average mass of a chlorine\natom is obtained by the weighted average of the masses of the two\nisotopes,  which works out to be\n=\n75.4 34.98 24.6 36.98\n100\n× + ×\n=  35.47 u\nwhich agrees with the atomic mass of chlorine.\nEven the lightest element, hydrogen has three isotopes having masses\n1.0078 u, 2.0141 u, and 3.0160 u.  The nucleus of the lightest atom of\nhydrogen, which has a relative abundance of 99.985%, is called the\nproton.  The mass of a proton is\n271.00727 u 1.67262 10 kgpm −= = × (13.2)\nThis is equal to the mass of the hydrogen atom (= 1.00783u), minus\nthe mass of a single electron (me = 0.00055 u).  The other two isotopes of\nhydrogen ar e called deuterium and tritium. T ritium nuclei, being\nunstable, do not occur naturally and are produced artificially in\nlaboratories.\nThe positive charge in the nucleus is that of the protons. A proton\ncarries one unit of fundamental charge and is stable. It was earlier thought\nthat the nucleus may contain electrons, but this was ruled out later using\narguments based on quantum theory. All the electrons of an atom are\noutside the nucleus. We know that the number of these electrons outside\nthe nucleus of the atom is Z, the atomic number. The total charge of the\nPhysics\n308\natomic electrons is thus (–Ze), and since the atom is neutral, the charge\nof the nucleus is (+Ze). The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom\nis, therefore, exactly Z, the atomic number.\nDiscovery of Neutron\nSince the nuclei of deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, they\nmust contain only one proton each.  But the masses of the nuclei of\nhydrogen, deuterium and tritium are in the ratio of 1:2:3.  Therefore, the\nnuclei of deuterium and tritium must contain,  in addition to a proton,\nsome neutral matter.  The amount of neutral matter present in the nuclei\nof these isotopes, expressed in units of mass of a proton, is approximately\nequal to one and two, respectively.  This fact indicates that the nuclei of\natoms contain, in addition to protons, neutral matter in multiples of a\nbasic unit.  This hypothesis was verified in 1932 by James Chadwick\nwho observed emission of neutral radiation when beryllium nuclei were\nbombarded with alpha-particles (\na-particles are helium nuclei, to be\ndiscussed in a later section). It was found that this neutral radiation\ncould knock out protons from light nuclei such as those of helium, carbon\nand nitrogen. The only neutral radiation known at that time was photons\n(electromagnetic radiation). Application of the principles of conservation\nof energy and momentum showed that if the neutral radiation consisted\nof photons, the energy of photons would have to be much higher than is\navailable from the bombardment of beryllium nuclei with\na-particles.\nThe clue to this puzzle, which Chadwick satisfactorily solved, was to\nassume that the neutral radiation consists of a new type of neutral\nparticles called neutrons.  From conservation of energy and momentum,\nhe was able to determine the mass of new particle ‘as very nearly the\nsame as mass of proton’.\nThe mass of a neutron is now known to a high degree of accuracy. It is\nmn = 1.00866 u = 1.6749×10 –27 kg (13.3)\nChadwick was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his\ndiscovery of the neutron.\nA free neutron, unlike a free proton, is unstable.  It decays into a\nproton, an electron and a antineutrino (another elementary particle), and\nhas a mean life of about 1000s.  It is, however, stable inside the nucleus.\nThe composition of a nucleus can now be described using the following\nterms and symbols:\nZ - atomic number = number of protons [13.4(a)]\nN - neutron number = number of neutrons [13.4(b)]\nA - mass number = Z + N\n= total number of protons and neutrons[13.4(c)]\nOne also uses the term nucleon for a proton or a neutron. Thus the\nnumber of nucleons in an atom is its mass number A.\nNuclear species or nuclides are shown by the notation\nXA\nZ  where X is\nthe chemical symbol of the species.  For example, the nucleus of gold is\ndenoted by 197\n79 Au.  It contains 197 nucleons, of which 79 are protons\nand the rest118 are neutrons.\n309\nNuclei\nThe composition of isotopes of an element can now be readily\nexplained.  The nuclei of isotopes of a given element contain the same\nnumber of protons, but differ from each other in their number of neutrons.\nDeuterium, 2\n1 H, which is an isotope of hydrogen, contains one proton\nand one neutron.

Although we cannot tear\napart a nucleus in this way, the nuclear binding energy is still a convenient\nmeasure of how well a nucleus is held together.  A more useful measure\nof the binding between the constituents of the nucleus is the binding\nenergy per nucleon, Ebn, which is the ratio of the binding energy Eb of a\nnucleus to the number of the nucleons, A, in that nucleus:\nEbn   =  Eb / A (13.9)\nWe can think of binding ener gy per nucleon as the average ener gy\nper nucleon needed to separate a nucleus into its individual nucleons.\nFigure 13.1 is a plot of the\nbinding energy per nucleon Ebn\nversus the mass number A for a\nlarge number of nuclei. We notice\nthe following main features of\nthe plot:\n(i) the binding energy per\nnucleon, Ebn, is practically\nconstant, i.e. practically\nindependent of the atomic\nnumber for nuclei of middle\nmass number ( 30 < A < 170).\nThe curve has a maximum of\nabout 8.75 MeV for A = 56\nand has a value of 7.6 MeV\nfor A = 238.\n(ii) Ebn is lower for both light\nnuclei ( A<30) and heavy\nnuclei (A>170).\nWe can draw some conclusions from these two observations:\n(i) The force is attractive and sufficiently strong to produce a binding\nenergy of a few MeV per nucleon.\n(ii) The constancy of the binding energy in the range 30 < A < 170 is a\nconsequence of the fact that the nuclear force is short-ranged. Consider\na particular nucleon inside a sufficiently large nucleus. It will be under\nthe influence of only some of its neighbours, which come within the\nrange of the nuclear force. If any other nucleon is at a distance more\nthan the range of the nuclear force from the particular nucleon it will\nhave no influence on the binding energy of the nucleon under\nconsideration. If a nucleon can have a maximum of p neighbours\nwithin the range of nuclear force, its binding energy would be\nproportional to p. Let the binding energy of the nucleus be pk, where\nk is a constant having the dimensions of energy. If we increase A by\nadding nucleons they will not change the binding energy of a nucleon\ninside. Since most of the nucleons in a large nucleus reside inside it\nand not on the surface, the change in binding energy per nucleon\nwould be small. The binding energy per nucleon is a constant and is\napproximately equal to pk.

Thus if a\nnucleus A = 240 breaks into two A = 120 nuclei, nucleons get more\ntightly bound. This implies energy would be released in the process.\nIt has very important implications for energy production through\nfission, to be discussed later in Section 13.7.1.\n(iv) Consider two very light nuclei ( A\n≤ 10) joining to form a heavier\nnucleus. The binding energy  per nucleon of the fused heavier nuclei\nis more than the binding energy per nucleon of the lighter nuclei.\nThis means that the final system is more tightly bound than the initial\nsystem.

In Section 13.4,  we have seen that for average mass\nnuclei the binding energy per nucleon is  approximately 8 MeV, which is\nmuch larger than the binding energy in atoms. Therefore, to bind a\nnucleus together there must be a strong attractive force of a totally\ndifferent kind. It must be strong enough to overcome the repulsion\nbetween the (positively charged) protons and to bind both protons and\nneutrons into the tiny nuclear volume. We have already seen\nthat the constancy of binding energy per nucleon can be\nunderstood in terms of its short-range. Many features of the\nnuclear binding force are summarised below. These are\nobtained from a variety of experiments carried out during 1930\nto 1950.\n(i) The nuclear force is much stronger than the Coulomb force\nacting between charges or the gravitational forces between\nmasses. The nuclear binding force has to dominate over\nthe Coulomb repulsive force between protons inside the\nnucleus. This happens only because the nuclear force is\nmuch stronger than the coulomb force. The gravitational\nforce is much weaker  than even Coulomb force.\n(ii) The nuclear force between two nucleons falls rapidly to\nzero as their distance is more than a few femtometres. This\nleads to saturation of forces in a medium or a large-sized\nnucleus, which is the reason for the constancy of the\nbinding energy per nucleon.\nA rough plot of the potential energy between two nucleons\nas a function of distance is shown in the Fig. 13.2.

In a nuclear reaction, elements may be transmuted. Thus,\nthe number of atoms of each element is not necessarily conserved\nin a nuclear r eaction. However , the number of pr otons and the\nnumber of neutrons are both separately conserved in a nuclear\nreaction. [Actually, even this is not strictly true in the realm of\nvery high energies – what is strictly conserved is the total charge\nand total ‘baryon number’. W e need not pursue this matter her e.]\nIn nuclear reactions (e.g., Eq. 13.10), the number of protons and\nthe number of neutrons are the same on the two sides of the equation.\n(b) We know that the binding ener gy of a nucleus gives a negative\ncontribution to the mass of the nucleus (mass defect). Now, since\nproton number and neutron number are conserved in a nuclear\nreaction, the total rest mass of neutrons and protons is the same\non either side of a reaction. But the total binding energy of nuclei\non the left side need not be the same as that on the right hand\nside. The difference in these binding energies appears as energy\nreleased or absorbed in a nuclear reaction. Since binding energy\nEXAMPLE 13.4\nPhysics\n318\nEXAMPLE 13.4\ncontributes to mass, we say that the difference in the total mass\nof nuclei on the two sides get converted into energy or vice-versa.\nIt is in these sense that a nuclear reaction is an example of mass-\nenergy interconversion.\n(c) From the point of view of mass-energy interconversion, a chemical\nreaction is similar to a nuclear reaction in principle. The energy\nreleased or absorbed in a chemical reaction can be traced to the\ndifference in chemical (not nuclear) binding energies of atoms\nand molecules on the two sides of a reaction. Since, strictly\nspeaking, chemical binding energy also gives a negative\ncontribution (mass defect) to the total mass of an atom or molecule,\nwe can equally well say that the difference in the total mass of\natoms or molecules, on the two sides of the chemical reaction\ngets converted into ener gy or vice-versa. However , the mass\ndefects involved in a chemical reaction are almost a million times\nsmaller than those in a nuclear reaction.This is the reason for\nthe general impression, (which is incorrec t) that mass-energy\ninterconversion does not take place in a chemical reaction.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "13", "chapter_title": "Nuclei", "type": "example", "identifier": "13.4", "title": "Example 13.4 Answer the following questions:", "page_start": 12, "page_end": 13, "level": 2, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "example_id": "13.4"}}, {"content": "SUMMARY\n1. An atom has a nucleus. The nucleus is positively charged. The radius\nof the nucleus is smaller than the radius of an atom by a factor of\n104. More than 99.9% mass of the atom is concentrated in the nucleus.\n2. On the atomic scale, mass is measured in atomic mass units (u). By\ndefinition, 1 atomic mass unit (1u) is 1/12 th mass of one atom of 12C;\n1u = 1.660563 × 10–27 kg.\n3. A nucleus contains a neutral particle called neutron. Its mass is almost\nthe same as that of proton\n4. The atomic number Z is the number of protons in the atomic nucleus\nof an element. The mass number A is the total number of protons and\nneutrons in the atomic nucleus; A = Z+N; Here N denotes the number\nof neutrons in the nucleus.\nA nuclear species or a nuclide is represented as\nXA\nZ , where X is the\nchemical symbol of the species.\nNuclides with the same atomic number Z, but different neutron number\nN are called isotopes. Nuclides with the same A are isobars and those\nwith the same N are isotones.\nMost elements are mixtures of two or more isotopes. The atomic mass\nof an element is a weighted average of the masses of its isotopes and\ncalculated in accordance to the relative abundances of the isotopes.\n5. A nucleus can be considered to be spherical in shape and assigned a\nradius. Electron scattering experiments allow determination of the\nnuclear radius; it is found that radii of nuclei fit the formula\nR = R0 A1/3,\nwhere R0 = a constant = 1.2 fm. This implies that the nuclear density\nis independent of A. It is of the order of 10 17 kg/m3.\n6. Neutrons and protons are bound in a nucleus by the short-range strong\nnuclear force. The nuclear force does not distinguish between neutron\nand proton.\n319\nNuclei\n7. The nuclear mass M is always less than the total mass, Sm, of its\nconstituents. The difference in mass of a nucleus and its constituents\nis called the mass defect,\nDM = (Z mp + (A – Z )mn) – M\nUsing Einstein’s mass energy relation, we express this mass difference\nin terms of energy as\nDEb = DM c2\nThe energy DEb represents the binding energy of the nucleus. In the\nmass number range A = 30 to 170, the binding energy per nucleon is\nnearly constant, about 8 MeV/nucleon.\n8. Energies associated with nuclear processes are about a million times\nlarger than chemical process.\n9. The Q-value of a nuclear process is\nQ = final kinetic energy – initial kinetic energy.\nDue to conservation of mass-energy, this is also,\nQ = (sum of initial masses – sum of final masses) c2\n10. Radioactivity is the phenomenon in which nuclei of a given species\ntransform by giving out a or\nb or g rays; a-rays are helium nuclei;\nb-rays are electrons. g-rays are electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths\nshorter than X-rays.\n11.

The density of nuclear matter is independent of the size of the nucleus.\nThe mass density of the atom does not follow this rule.\n2. The radius of a nucleus determined by electron scattering is found to\nbe slightly different from that determined by alpha-particle scattering.\nThis is because electron scattering senses the charge distribution of\nthe nucleus, whereas alpha and similar particles sense the nuclear\nmatter.\n3. After Einstein showed the equivalence of mass and energy, E = mc 2,\nwe cannot any longer speak of separate laws of conservation of mass\nand conservation of energy, but we have to speak of a unified law of\nconservation of mass and energy. The most convincing evidence that\nthis principle operates in nature comes from nuclear physics. It is\ncentral to our understanding of nuclear energy and harnessing it as a\nsource of power. Using the principle, Q of a nuclear process (decay or\nreaction) can be expressed also in terms of initial and final masses.\n4. The nature of the binding energy (per nucleon) curve shows that\nexothermic nuclear reactions are possible, when two light nuclei fuse\nor when a heavy nucleus undergoes fission into nuclei with intermediate\nmass.\n5. For fusion, the light nuclei must have sufficient initial energy to\novercome the coulomb potential barrier . That is why fusion r equires\nvery high temperatures.\n6. Although the binding energy (per nucleon) curve is smooth and slowly\nvarying, it shows peaks at nuclides like 4He, 16O etc. This is considered\nas evidence of atom-like shell structure in nuclei.\n7. Electron and positron are a particle-antiparticle pair. They are identical\nin mass; their charges are equal in magnitude and opposite. (It is\nfound that when an electr on and a positr on come together , they\nannihilate each other giving energy in the form of gamma-ray photons.)\n8. Radioactivity is an indication of the instability of nuclei. Stability\nrequires the ratio of neutron to proton to be around 1:1 for light\nnuclei. This ratio increases to about 3:2 for heavy nuclei. (More\nneutrons are required to overcome the effect of repulsion among the\nprotons.) Nuclei which are away from the stability ratio, i.e., nuclei\nwhich have an excess of neutrons  or protons are unstable. In fact,\nonly about 10% of knon isotopes (of all elements), are stable.

Relative values of the resistivity\nare not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and\nsemiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which\nwill become clear as we go along in this chapter.\nOur interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which\ncould be:\n(i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge\n(ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:\n· Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.\n· Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.\n· Organic polymers:  polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.\nMost of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on\nelemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic\nsemiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using\n325\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\norganic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been\ndeveloped signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer -\nelectronics and molecular -electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict\nourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly\nelemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced\nhere for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply\nto most of the compound semiconductors as well.\nOn the basis of energy bands\nAccording to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of\nany of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when\nthe atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So\nthe outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very\nclose or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion\nin a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.\nInside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two\nelectrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because\nof this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different\nenergy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called\nenergy bands.  The energy band which includes the energy levels of the\nvalence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the\nvalence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all\nthe valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in\nthe conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the\nvalence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into\nthe conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when\nit overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is\nthe case with metallic conductors.\nIf there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence\nband, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons\nare available in the conduction band. This makes the material an\ninsulator. But some of the electr ons from the valence band may gain\nexternal energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the\nvalence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band.\nAt the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band\nwhere other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the\npossibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as\ndue to vacancies in the valence band.\nLet us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing\nN atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge\nit is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost\norbit is 4 (2s\nand 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons\nin the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the\nouter orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there\nare 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either\nform a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands\ndepending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box\non Band Theory of Solids).\nAt the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge,\nthe energy band of these 8 N states is split apart into two which are\nseparated by an energy gap Eg (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is\ncompletely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute\nzero is the valence band.  The other band consisting of 4N energy states,\ncalled the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero.\nPhysics\n326\nThe lowest energy level in the\nconduction band is shown as EC and\nhighest energy level in the valence band\nis shown as EV. Above EC and below EV\nthere are a large number of closely spaced\nenergy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.\nThe gap between the top of the  valence\nband and bottom of the conduction band\nis called the energy band gap (Energy gap\nEg). It may be large, small, or zero,\ndepending upon the material. These\ndifferent situations, are depicted in Fig.\n14.2 and discussed below:\nCase I:  This refers to a situation, as\nshown in Fig. 14.2(a). One can have a\nmetal either when the conduction band\nis partially filled and the balanced band\nis partially empty or when the conduction\nand valance bands overlap. When there\nis overlap electrons from valence band can\neasily move into the conduction band.\nThis situation makes a  large number of\nelectrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is\npartially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level\nmaking conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials\nis low or the conductivity is high.\nFIGURE 14.2  Difference between energy bands of (a) metals,\n(b) insulators and (c) semiconductors.\nFIGURE 14.1 The energy band positions in a\nsemiconductor at 0 K. The upper band, called the\nconduction band, consists of infinitely large number\nof closely spaced energy states. The lower band,\ncalled the valence band, consists of closely spaced\ncompletely filled energy states.\n327\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nCase II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap Eg exists\n(Eg > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore\nno electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large\nthat electrons cannot be excited from the valence band  to the conduction\nband by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators.\nCase III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small\nband gap ( Eg < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room\ntemperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough\nenergy to cross the energy gap and enter the  conduction band. These\nelectrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band.\nHence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the\ninsulators.\nIn this section we have made a broad classification of metals,\nconductors and semiconductors.

These structures\nare called the  diamond-like structures. Each atom is\nsurrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that\nSi and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline\nstructure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its\nfour valence electrons with each of its four nearest\nneighbour atoms, and also to take share of one electron\nfrom each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs\nare referred to as forming a  covalent bond or simply a\nvalence bond. The two shared electrons can be assumed\nto shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms\nholding them together strongly.

It shows an idealised picture in which no\nbonds are broken (all bonds are intact). Such a situation\narises at low temperatures. As the temperature increases,\nmore thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of\nthese electrons may break–away (becoming free electrons contributing to\nconduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the\ncrystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a).\nThe neighbourhood, from which the free electron (with charge –q) has come\nout leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q).

That is\nne = nh = ni (14.1)\nwhere ni is called intrinsic carrier concentration.\nSemiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from\nelectrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown\nFIGURE 14.3  Three-dimensional dia-\nmond-like crystal structure for Carbon,\nSilicon or Germanium with\nrespective lattice spacing a equal\nto 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 Å.\nPhysics\n328\nin Fig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be\nvisualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron\nfrom the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to\nthe vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump,\nthe hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an\nelectron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has\nmoved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron\noriginally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved\nin this process of hole motion. The free electron\nmoves completely independently as conduction\nelectron and gives rise to an electron current, Ie\nunder an applied electric field. Remember that\nthe motion of hole is only a convenient way of\ndescribing the actual motion of bound electrons,\nwhenever there is an empty bond anywhere in\nthe crystal. Under the action of an electric field,\nthese holes move towards negative potential\ngiving the hole current, Ih. The total current, I is\nthus the sum of the electron current Ie and the\nhole current Ih:\nI = Ie + Ih (14.2)\nIt may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction\nelectrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in\nwhich the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of\ngeneration is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The\nrecombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.\nFIGURE 14.4  Schematic two-dimensional\nrepresentation of Si or Ge structure showing\ncovalent bonds at low temperature\n(all bonds intact). +4 symbol\nindicates inner cores of Si or Ge.\nFIGURE 14.5 (a) Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron\ndue to thermal energy at moderate temperatures.

As\nsuch, no important electronic devices can be developed using these\nsemiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their\nconductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities.\nWhen a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable\nimpurity is added to the pur e semiconductor, the conductivity of the\nsemiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors . The deliberate\naddition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms\nare called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor.\nThe dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure\nsemiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original\nsemiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain\nthis is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should\nbe nearly the same.\nThere are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si\nor Ge:\n(i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous\n(P), etc.\nFIGURE 14.6 (a)  An intrinsic semiconductor at T = 0 K\nbehaves like insulator. (b)  At T > 0 K, four ther mally generated\nelectron-hole pairs. The filled circles ( ) represent electrons\nand empty circles ( ) represent holes.\nPhysics\n330\n(ii) Trivalent (valency 3); like Indium (In),\nBoron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc.\nWe shall now discuss how the doping\nchanges the number of charge carriers (and\nhence the conductivity) of semiconductors.\nSi or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the\nPeriodic table and, therefore, we choose the\ndopant element from nearby fifth or third\ngroup, expecting and taking care that the\nsize of the dopant atom is nearly the same as\nthat of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent\nand trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two\nentirely different types of semiconductors as\ndiscussed below.\n(i)  n-type semiconductor\nSuppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent\nelement as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom\nof  +5 valency element  occupies the position\nof an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of\nits electrons bond with the four silicon\nneighbours while the fifth remains very\nweakly bound to its parent atom. This is\nbecause the four electrons participating in\nbonding are seen as part of the effective core\nof the atom by the fifth electron. As a result\nthe ionisation energy required to set this\nelectron free is very small and even at room\ntemperature it will be free to move in the\nlattice of the semiconductor. For example, the\nenergy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium,\nand 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this\nelectron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump\nthe forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for\nsilicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor.  Thus, the\npentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and\nhence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made\navailable for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the\ndoping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature.\nOn the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number\nof holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.\nIn a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons\nne is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated\nintrinsically, while the total number of holes nh is only due to the holes\nfrom the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would\nincrease due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the\nnumber of holes would get reduced further.\nThus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons\ncan be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic\nFIGURE 14.7 (a) Pentavalent donor atom (As, Sb,\nP, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n-\ntype semiconductor, and (b) Commonly used\nschematic representation of n-type material\nwhich shows only the fixed cores of the\nsubstituent donors with one additional effective\npositive charge and its associated extra electron.\n331\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nsemiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons\nbecome the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers.\nThese semiconductors are, therefore, known as n -type\nsemiconductors. For n-type semiconductors, we have,\nne >> nh (14.3)\n(ii)  p-type semiconductor\nThis is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity\nlike Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than\nSi or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with\nneighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to\noffer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth\nneighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as\nshown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice\nwants an electron in place of a hole, an electron  in the outer\norbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this\nvacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole\nis available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom\nbecomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth\nelectron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom\nof p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge\nalong with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is\nobvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are\nin addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source\nof conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for\nsuch a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons\nare minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped\nwith trivalent impurity are called p -type semiconductors. For\np-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce\nthe number ( ni)of intrinsically generated electrons to ne.\nWe have, for p-type semiconductors\nnh >> ne (14.4)\nNote that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality\nas the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and\nopposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice.\nIn extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of\nmajority current carriers, the minority carriers produced\nthermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and\nthus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of\ncurrent carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly\nhelps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers.\nThe semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In\nthe case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor\nimpurities (ED) and acceptor impurities (EA) also exist. In the energy band\ndiagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level ED is slightly\nbelow the bottom EC of the conduction band and electrons from this level\nmove into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room\ntemperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~10 12)\natoms of Si get ionised.  So the conduction band will have most electrons\ncoming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly ,\nFIGURE 14.8  (a) Trivalent\nacceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.)\ndoped in tetravalent Si or Ge\nlattice giving p-type semicon-\nductor. (b) Commonly used\nschematic representation of\np-type material which shows\nonly the fixed core of the\nsubstituent acceptor with\none effective additional\nnegative charge and its\nassociated hole.\nPhysics\n332\nEXAMPLE 14.2\nfor p-type semiconductor, the acceptor energy level EA is slightly above\nthe top EV of the valence band as shown in Fig. 14.9(b). With very small\nsupply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level\nEA and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that\nwith very small supply of energy the hole from level EA sinks down into\nthe valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain\nexternal energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get\nionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the\ndensity of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in\nthe extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a\nsemiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by\nnenh = ni\n2 (14.5)\nThough the above description is grossly approximate and\nhypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals,\ninsulators and semiconductors (extrinsic and intrinsic) in a simple\nmanner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon\nthe energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C\n(diamond), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV,\nrespectively. Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the\nenergy gap in its case  is 0 eV.\nFIGURE 14.9 Energy bands of (a) n-type semiconductor at T > 0K, (b) p-type\nsemiconductor at T > 0K.", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "14", "chapter_title": "Semiconductor Electronics", "type": "section", "identifier": "14.4", "title": "EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTOR", "page_start": 7, "page_end": 10, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["14.7", "14.8", "14.9"], "figure_count": 3, "section_id": "14.4", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "Example 14.2 Suppose a pure Si crystal has 5 × 10 28 atoms m–3.

By adding\nprecisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer\ncan be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a\nsemiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and\nn-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.\nTwo important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction:\ndiffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor , the\nconcentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more\ncompared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type\nsemiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration\nof electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the\nconcentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side\nto n-side (p ® n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n ® p). This\nmotion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.\nWhen an electron diffuses from n ® p, it leaves behind an ionised\ndonor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is\nbonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse\nfrom n ® p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on\nn-side of the junction is developed.\nSimilarly, when a hole diffuses from p ® n due to the concentration\ngradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is\nimmobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or\nnegative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed.\nThis space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known\nas depletion region as the electrons and holes  taking\npart in the initial movement across the junction depleted\nthe region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness\nof depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a\nmicrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on\nn-side of the junction and negative space charge region\non p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from\npositive charge towards negative charge develops. Due\nto this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves\nto n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p-\nside. The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field\nis called drift.  Thus a drift current, which is opposite in\ndirection to the diffusion current (Fig. 14.10) starts.\nFIGURE 14.10  p-n junction\nformation process.\nFormation and working of p-n junction diode\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/pnjun.html\nPhysics\n334\nEXAMPLE 14.3\nInitially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small.\nAs the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions\non either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric\nfield strength  and hence drift current. This process continues\nuntil the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n\njunction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there\nis no net current.\nThe loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of\nelectron by the p-region causes a  difference of potential across\nthe junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is\nsuch as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of\nequilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at\nequilibrium and the potential across the junction. The\nn-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired\nelectrons.

This drift of carriers\ngives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few mA.

When V = Vbr, the diode reverse current\nincreases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes\nlarge change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by\nan external circuit below the rated value (specified by the\nmanufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds\nthe rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This\ncan happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward\ncurrent exceeds the rated value.\nThe circuit arrangement for studying the V-I characteristics\nof a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied\nvoltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16(a) and (b).

So if an alternating voltage is\napplied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle\nwhen the diode is forward biased. This property\nis used to rectify alternating voltages and the\ncircuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.\nIf an alternating voltage is applied across a\ndiode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will\nappear across the load only during the half cycles\nof the ac input during which the diode is forward\nbiased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in\nFig. 14.18, is called a half-wave r ectifier. The\nsecondary of a transformer supplies the desired\nac voltage across terminals A and B. When the\nvoltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased\nand it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is\nreverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse\nsaturation current of a diode is negligible and can\nbe considered equal to zero for practical purposes.\n(The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must\nbe sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at\nthe secondary of the transformer to protect the\ndiode from reverse breakdown.)\nTherefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there\nis a current through the load resistor RL and we\nget an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b),\nwhereas there is no current in the negative half-\ncycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get\nthe output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is\nrestricted to only one direction  and is said to be rectified. Since the\nrectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is\ncalled as half-wave rectifier.\nThe circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output\nrectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative\nhalf of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the\np-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the\ntransformer. The n-side of the diodes ar e connected together and the\noutput is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint\nof the secondary of the transfor mer. So for a full-wave r ectifier the\nsecondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it\nis called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen fr om Fig.14.19(c) the\nvoltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.\nEach diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate\ncycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-\ntap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that\nthere is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-\ntap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A\nFIGURE 14.18  (a) Half-wave rectifier\ncircuit, (b) Input ac voltage and output\nvoltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit.\n339\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nwith respect to the centre tap at any instant\nis positive. It is clear that, at that instant,\nvoltage at B being out of phase will be\nnegative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode\nD1 gets forward biased and conducts (while\nD2 being reverse biased is not conducting).\nHence, during this positive half cycle we get\nan output current (and a output voltage\nacross the load resistor RL) as shown in\nFig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle\nwhen the voltage at A becomes negative with\nrespect to centre tap, the voltage at B would\nbe positive. In this part of the cycle diode\nD1 would not conduct but diode D2 would,\ngiving an output current and output\nvoltage (across RL) during the negative half\ncycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output\nvoltage during both the positive as well as\nthe negative half of the cycle. Obviously,\nthis is a more efficient circuit for getting\nrectified voltage or current than the half-\nwave rectifier.\nThe rectified voltage is in the form of\npulses of the shape of half sinusoids.\nThough it is unidirectional it does not have\na steady value. To get steady dc output\nfrom the pulsating voltage normally a\ncapacitor is connected across the output\nterminals (parallel to the load RL). One can\nalso use an inductor in series with RL for\nthe same purpose. Since these additional\ncircuits appear to filter out the ac ripple\nand give a pure dc voltage, so they are\ncalled filters.\nNow we shall discuss the role of\ncapacitor in filtering. When the voltage\nacross the capacitor is rising, it gets\ncharged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage\nof the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through\nthe load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of\nrectified output it again gets charged to the peak value (Fig. 14.20). The\nrate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the\nproduct of capacitance C and the effective resistance RL used in the circuit\nand is called the time constant.  To make the time constant large value of\nC should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The\noutput voltage obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the\npeak voltage of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely\nused in power supplies.\nFIGURE 14.19  (a) A Full-wave rectifier\ncircuit; (b) Input wave forms given to the\ndiode D1 at A and to the diode D 2 at B;\n(c) Output waveform across the\nload RL connected in the full-wave\nrectifier circuit.\nPhysics\n340\nFIGURE 14.20  (a) A full-wave r ectifier with capacitor filter , (b) Input and output\nvoltage of rectifier in (a).", "metadata": {"class": "12", "chapter": "14", "chapter_title": "Semiconductor Electronics", "type": "section", "identifier": "14.7", "title": "APPLICATION OF JUNCTION DIODE AS A RECTIFIER", "page_start": 16, "page_end": 18, "level": 1, "spans_multiple_pages": true, "figures": ["14.18", "14.19", "14.20"], "figure_count": 3, "section_id": "14.7", "is_conceptual": true}}, {"content": "SUMMARY\n1. Semiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state\nelectronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.\n2. Lattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements\ndecide whether a particular material will be insulator , metal or\nsemiconductor.\n3. Metals have low resistivity (10–2 to 10–8 Wm), insulators have very high\nresistivity (>108 W m–1), while semiconductors have intermediate values\nof resistivity.\n4. Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs,\nCdS, etc.).\n5. Pure semiconductors are called ‘intrinsic semiconductors’. The presence\nof charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an ‘intrinsic’ property of the\nmaterial and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The\nnumber of electrons (ne) is equal to the number of holes (\nnh ) in intrinsic\nconductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective\npositive charge.\n6. The number of charge carriers can be changed by  ‘doping’ of a suitable\nimpurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type).\n7. In n-type semiconductors, ne >> nh while in p-type semiconductors nh >> ne.\n8. n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent\natoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained\nby doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc.\n9. nenh = ni\n2 in all cases. Further, the material possesses an overall charge\nneutrality.\n10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and\nconduction band) in which the electr ons in a material lie. V alence\nband energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All\nenergy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the\nconduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in\nthe conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for\nthe conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy\ngap (Eg) between the top of valence band ( EV ) and the bottom of the\nconduction band EC. The electrons from valence band can be excited by\n341\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nheat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce\na change in the current flowing in a semiconductor.\n11. For insulators Eg > 3 eV, for semiconductors Eg is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while\nfor metals Eg » 0.\n12. p-n junction is the ‘key’ to all semiconductor devices. When such a\njunction is made, a ‘depletion layer’ is formed consisting of immobile\nion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a\njunction potential barrier.\n13. By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be\nchanged. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the\nbattery and p-side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased\nwhile the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current\nis more (mA) while it is very small (mA) in a p-n junction diode.\n14. Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage\nto one direction).

Further we do not have a simple lens\nequation true for all u (and v) in terms of a definite constant of the\nsystem  (the constant being determined by f1 and f2, and the separation\nbetween the lenses).

The latter is the ratio of the angular size of the object\n(which is equal to the angular size of the image even if the image\nis magnified) to the angular size of the object if placed at the near\npoint (25  cm). Thus, magnification magnitude is |( v\n/u)| and\nmagnifying power is (25/ |u|). Only when the image is located at\nthe near point |v| = 25  cm, are the two quantities equal.\n9.23 (a) Maximum magnifying power is obtained when the image is at\nthe near point (25  cm)\nu =  – 7.14 cm.\n(b) Magnitude of magnification = (25/ | u|) = 3.5.\n(c) Magnifying power  = 3.5\nYes, the magnifying power (when the image is produced at 25 cm)\nis equal to the magnitude of magnification.\n9.24 Magnification  =\n( . / ) 6 25 1 = 2.5\nv = +2.5u\n  \n1\n2 5\n1 1\n10. u u\ni.e.,u = – 6 cm\n|v| = 15 cm\nThe virtual image is closer than the normal  near point (25  cm) and\ncannot be seen by the eye distinctly.\n9.25 (a) Even though the absolute image size is bigger than the object\nsize, the angular size of the image is equal to the angular size of\nthe object. The magnifier helps in the following way: without it\nobject would be placed no closer than 25\ncm;  with it the object\ncan be placed much closer . The closer object has lar ger angular\nsize than the same object at 25 cm. It is in this sense that angular\nmagnification is achieved.\n(b) Yes, it decr eases a little because the angle subtended at the eye\nis then slightly less than the angle subtended at the lens. The\n349\nAnswers\neffect is negligible if the image is at a very large distance away.\n[Note:  When the eye is separated from the lens , the angles\nsubtended at the eye by the first object and its image are not\nequal.]\n(c) First, grinding lens of very small focal length is not easy. More\nimportant, if you decrease focal length, aberrations (both spherical\nand chromati c) become more pronounced. So, in practice, you\ncannot  get a magnifying power of more than 3 or so with a simple\nconvex lens. However, using an aberration corrected lens system,\none can increase this limit by a factor of 10 or so.\n(d) Angular magnification of eye-piece is [(25/fe) + 1] ( fe in cm) which\nincr\neases if fe is smaller. Further, magnification of the objective\nis given by\nO\nO O O\n1\n| | (| |/ ) 1\nv\nu u f\n=\n−\nwhich is large when  O| |u  is slightly greater than fO. The micro-\nscope is used for viewing very close object. So O| |u  is small, and\nso is fO.\n(e) The image of the objective in the eye-piece is known as ‘ey e-ring’.\nAll the rays from the object refracted by objective go through the\neye-ring. Therefore, it is an ideal position for our eyes for viewing.\nIf we place our eyes too close to the eye-piece, we shall not collect\nmuch of the light and also reduce our field of view. If we position\nour eyes on the eye-ring and the area of the pupil of our eye is\ngreater or equal to the area of the eye-ring, our eyes will collect\nall the light refracted by the objective. The precise location of\nthe eye-ring naturally depends on the separation between the\nobjective and the eye-piece. When you view through a microscope\nby placing your eyes on one end,the ideal distance between the\neyes and eye-piece is usually built-in the design of the\ninstrument.\n9.26 Assume microscope in normal use i.e., image at 25  cm.
